#### Introduction

#### First message


#### Scenario with add

You just want to add files with specific extension in your staging area. Of course you can add all the files one by one. But you can use `*.<extension_name>` to include all files with that extension.
Following command will add all python files.

`git add *.py`

You want to add files with specific extension and also want to specify directory name then you can run the following command. The following command will add all python files from sub directories of models/ directory.

`git add models/\*.py`


#### Scenario with clean

You created some new files or folders in your branch. After some time you realized that you don’t want those files or folders. You need your working tree clean. These are untracked files in git.

**Untracked files are those which you didn’t add already using git add**

To make your working tree clean you can run the following command. This command will delete all files and directories that are not tracked by git.

`git clean -df`

If you want to see which untracked files will be removed before removing then you can run this command.

`git clean -dn`

#### Scenario with rm

Now you want to delete your tracked files. You can delete your tracked file using this command.

`git rm <file-path>`

If your file is in staging area then you have to give additional force flag.

`git rm <file-path> -f`

You want to delete files from git repository but not from your file system then you can run this command.

`git rm --cached <file-path>`
