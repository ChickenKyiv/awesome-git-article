#### Introduction

#### First message


#### Scenario with add

You just want to add files with specific extension in your staging area. Of course you can add all the files one by one. But you can use `*.<extension_name>` to include all files with that extension.
Following command will add all python files.

`git add *.py`

You want to add files with specific extension and also want to specify directory name then you can run the following command. The following command will add all python files from sub directories of models/ directory.

`git add models/\*.py`


#### Scenario with clean

You created some new files or folders in your branch. After some time you realized that you don’t want those files or folders. You need your working tree clean. These are untracked files in git.

**Untracked files are those which you didn’t add already using git add**

To make your working tree clean you can run the following command. This command will delete all files and directories that are not tracked by git.

`git clean -df`

If you want to see which untracked files will be removed before removing then you can run this command.

`git clean -dn`

#### Scenario with rm

Now you want to delete your tracked files. You can delete your tracked file using this command.

`git rm <file-path>`

If your file is in staging area then you have to give additional force flag.

`git rm <file-path> -f`

You want to delete files from git repository but not from your file system then you can run this command.

`git rm --cached <file-path>`

#### Scenario with branch

You have made a typo in your branch name or you want to change your branch name, then the following command will change your branch name.

`git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>``

You want to change the current branch name, then you can just run the following command.

`git branch -m <new-branch-name> ``

If you’ve already pushed the branch with old name, then there are a couple of extra steps required. You need to delete the old branch from the remote and push up the new one.

```
git push <remote-name> --delete <old-branch-name>
git push <remote-name> <new-branch-name>
```

You want to push your local branch code but your local branch name doesn’t match with the name of remote repository branch name. Then you can run the following command.

`git push <remote-name> <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name> ``


#### Scenario with log

You want to see your commit history so you just ran a `git log` command. This shows a lot of information but you just need to see commit id and message. Then you can run the following command.

`git log --oneline`
`git log --oneline` will show the following kind of output.

[IMG]

The first seven character in above output is the **shorthand commit id** and then we have our commit message. The commit id is shorthand because the full commit id is forty hexadecimal characters that specify a 160-bit SHA-1 hash. Notice `Head -> master` .

This means we are now in master branch.
If you want to see the commit message of a specific author, then you can run the following command. I am assuming the author name is John Doe.

`git log --author="John Doe"``


#### Scenario with stash

You are working in a branch and made some changes. Now, you want to just see the output or code of that branch before you made those changes. Then you can run stash command. It will make your working tree clean.

`git stash`

If you want your changes back then you have to run the following command.

`git stash pop`

If you don’t want those changes back then you have to run the following command.

`git stash drop`

You changed some files in wrong branch. Then you can stash your changes and checkout to your desired branch and run `git stash pop` there. You will get your changes in your desired branch.

#### Scenario with checkout

You want to switch to a branch. Then you can just run the following command.

`git checkout <branch-name>``

**If you already changed some file in your current branch, then be sure to `stash` your changes or `commit` the changes. . If you don’t `stash` or `commit` those changes, it will also reflect in your switched branch which you may not want or need.**

You have a branch name `development` and you want to make a branch from `development` and switch to your new branch directly. Then you can run the following command.

```
(at development) $ git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

You can also checkout using commit id. You can use shorthand commit id safely if your project isn’t very large.

`git checkout <commit-id>``

This will fall in **detached head state** in git. **Head** is simply a reference to the current commit (latest) on the current branch.
Generally, **Head** in git can point to a branch or a commit.
When Head points to a branch, git doesn’t complain. But when head points to a commit, but not a branch then it goes to a **detached head** state.


You want to develop a feature from this **detached head** state then you have to make a branch from this state and develop your feature there.

`git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>``


#### Scenario with commit

You just added a commit message and realized that there is a typo in your commit or you just want to make your commit message more expressive and understandable. Then you can use the following git command.

`git commit --amend -m "your-new-commit-message"``

If you just added some files or fixed a bug but don’t want to add another commit message then you can use following git command with `--no-edit` flag.

`git commit --amend --no-edit`

**Here one thing is very important to remember that amending the last commit rewrites the commit history. It means your `commit id` will change when you amend a commit.**

If you already pushed your code in the remote repository and then you realized that you have to `amend` your commit message then after amending, you have to make a **force push**. Assuming your remote name as `origin` you can run the following command.

`git push origin <branch-name> -f`

#### Scenario with reset

You want to discard your last some commits. Then you can use `git reset` to discard those commits. There are three flag for git reset that you should know.
- `--soft`
- `--mixed`
- `--hard`
[IMG]

Let’s assume you want to discard the changes until **added two.txt** which has commit id **96b037c**

Now, let’s run git reset command with `--soft flag.`

`git reset --soft 96b037c`

`git reset --soft` will make **orphan** all the commits after that commit id (e.g. **96b037c**) but the files will not be deleted.
The files will be in the staging area.

**Orphaned** commit means there is no direct path from a ref to access them. These orphaned commits can usually be found and restored using `git reflog` Git will permanently delete any orphaned commits after it runs the internal garbage collector.

**By default, git is configured to run the garbage collector every 30 days.**

So, if you run `git status` you will see the following output.

[IMG]

If you run `git log --oneline` you will see that previous commits are deleted.

[IMG]

If you run reset command with `--mixed` flag then your commits will be **orphaned** and the files will not be in staging area but the files will be found in the file system. If you don’t specify any flag in reset then git will use `--mixed` flag as default.

If you run `git status` then you will see the following output.

[IMG]

If you want to permanently delete the files then you can run reset command with `--hard` flag.

**A good practice you can follow that you first run reset command with `--soft` flag and see the affected files. If you are sure that you don’t want those changes then you can run the reset command with `--hard` flag.
**

You should never use `git reset <commit-id>` when any snapshots after **<commit-id>** have been pushed to a public repository.

Removing a commit that other team members have continued developing poses serious problems for collaboration.

#### Scenario with revert



#### Scenario with cherry-pick
