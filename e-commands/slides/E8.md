`git stash`

If you want your changes back then you have to run the following command.

`git stash pop`

If you donâ€™t want those changes back then you have to run the following command.

`git stash drop`

You changed some files in wrong branch. Then you can stash your changes and checkout to your desired branch and run `git stash pop` there. You will get your changes in your desired branch.
