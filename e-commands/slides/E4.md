#### Scenario with clean

You created some new files or folders in your branch. After some time you realized that you don’t want those files or folders. You need your working tree clean. These are untracked files in git.

**Untracked files are those which you didn’t add already using git add**

To make your working tree clean you can run the following command. This command will delete all files and directories that are not tracked by git.

`git clean -df`

If you want to see which untracked files will be removed before removing then you can run this command.

`git clean -dn`
