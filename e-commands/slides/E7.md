#### Scenario with log

You want to see your commit history so you just ran a `git log` command. This shows a lot of information but you just need to see commit id and message. Then you can run the following command.

`git log --oneline`
`git log --oneline` will show the following kind of output.

![xxx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-git-article/master/img/commands/01-log.png)

The first seven character in above output is the **shorthand commit id** and then we have our commit message. The commit id is shorthand because the full commit id is forty hexadecimal characters that specify a 160-bit SHA-1 hash. Notice `Head -> master` .

This means we are now in master branch.
If you want to see the commit message of a specific author, then you can run the following command. I am assuming the author name is John Doe.

`git log --author="John Doe"``
