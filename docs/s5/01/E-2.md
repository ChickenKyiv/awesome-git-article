#### First message

We don't touching here merge scenario, because this topic is huge and it better to be talked separately.

{!!!! EXPLAIN MORE }

Welcome to course, where you will learn about advanced usages of basic git commands.

For this course, I tried to pack a lot of different cases-situations-scenarios that can become a reality in your daily work.

Cases like that are pretty common:
- I forget what was done?
- I want to revert changes that generate a bug.
- I staged too many edits, and I want to break them out into a separate commit?

All of the situations that were covered in this course looks pretty simple and straight-forward, but when situation appear - you should what to do.

This course is about learning how to apply basic commands like, commit, checkout, log, diff, stash and use them for troubleshooting.

You will learn about more than 30 cases, that can be useful for software developers.

---

This course will guide you through different real-life situations, that can be solved by using Gitcommands.
It will give you a better understanding of how to do stuff and can help you to be a better developer and you will be able to avoid some major problems in the future of your coding career.

## Cheatsheet

A collection of useful commands to use throughout the exercises:

```shell
# Cloning a repository
git clone https://github.com/praqma-training/git-katas.git      # Clone this repository to your current working directory

# See local changes
git status                  # Show the working tree status
git diff                    # Show changes current working directory (not yet staged)
git diff --cached           # Show changes currently staged for commit

# Add files to staging (before a commit)
git add myfile.txt          # Add myfile.txt to stage
git add .                   # Add entire working directory to stage

# Make a commit
git commit                              # Make a new commit with the changes in your staging area. This will open an editor for a commit message.
git commit -m "I love documentation"    # Make a new commit with a commit message from the command line
git commit -a                           # Make a new commit and automatically "add" changes from all known files
git commit -am "I still do!"            # A combination of the above
git commit --amend                      # Re-do the commit message of the previous commit (don't do this after pushing!)
                                        #   We _never_ change "public history"

# Configuring a different editor
## Avoid Vim but stay in terminal:
- `git config --global core.editor nano`

## For Windows:
- Use Notepad:
`git config --global core.editor notepad`

- or for instance Notepad++:
`git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`



# See history
git log             # Show commit logs
git log --oneline   # Formats commits to a single line (shorthand for --pretty=oneline  --abbrev-commit )
git log --graph     # Show a graph commits and branches

# Working with Branches
git branch my-branch       # Create a new branch called my-branch
git checkout my-branch     # Checkout ("Switch" to work on) my-branch
git checkout -b my-branch  # Create a new branch called my-branch AND switch to it
git branch -d my-branch    # Delete branch my-branch that has been merged with master
git branch -D my-branch    # Forcefully delete a branch my-branch that hasn't been merged to master

# Merging
git merge master         # Merge the master branch into your currently checked out branch.
git rebase master        # Rebase current branch on top of master branch

# Working with Remotes
git remote              # Show your current remotes
git remote -v           # Show your current remotes and their URLs
git push                # Publish your commits to the upstream master of your currently checked out branch
git pull                # Pull changes from the remote to your currently checked out branch

# Aliases - it's possible to make aliases of frequently used commands
#   This is often done to make a command shorter, or to add default flags

# Adding a shorthand "co" for "checkout"
git config --global alias.co "checkout"
# Usage:
git co      # Does a "git checkout"

## Logging
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all # Show a nice graph of the previous commits
## Adding an alias called "lol" (log oneline..) that shows the above
git config --global alias.lol "log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all"
## Using the alias
git lol     # Does a "git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all"
```

When learning git, you might find **Head** term.
**HEAD** is a reference to the last commit in the currently check-out branch. You can think of the HEAD as the "current branch".

When you switch branches with **git checkout**, the **HEAD** revision changes to point to the tip of the new branch.








#### Confirm the receiving branch


Execute `git status` to ensure that **HEAD** is pointing to the correct merge-receiving branch.

If needed, execute `git checkout <receiving branch>` to switch to the receiving branch.

You can close corresponding issues using a keyword in your pull request or commit message.

**Close Git issue from commit**

The following keywords, followed by an issue number, will close the issue:

- `close`
- `closes`
- `closed`
- `fix`
- `fixes`
- `fixed`
- `resolve`
- `resolves`
- `resolved`

For example, to close an issue numbered 123,
you could use the phrase **"Closes #123"** or **"Closes: #123"** in your pull request description or commit message.

Once the branch is merged into the default branch, the issue will close.
