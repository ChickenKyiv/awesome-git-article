#### I want to discard all of my untracked files

If you want to see which files will be deleted you can use the **-n** option before you run the actual command:
`git clean -n`


Then when you are comfortable (because it will delete the files for real!) use the **-f** option:
`git clean -f`

Here are some more options for you to delete directories, files, ignored and non-ignored files

To remove directories, run `git clean -f -d` or `git clean -fd`
To remove ignored files, run `git clean -f -X` or `git clean -fX`

To remove ignored and non-ignored files, run `git clean -f -x` or `git clean -fx`

**Note the case difference on the X for the two latter commands.**
