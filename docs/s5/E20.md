#### I want to delete or remove my last commit

If you need to delete pushed commits, you can use the following.

However, it will irreversibly change your history, and mess up the history of anyone else who had already pulled from the repository.

In short, if you're not sure, you should never do this, ever.

```
$ git reset HEAD^ --hard
$ git push --force-with-lease [remote] [branch]
```

If you haven't pushed, to reset Git to the state it was in before you made your last commit (while keeping your staged changes):

`(my-branch*)$ git reset --soft HEAD@{1}`

This only works if you haven't pushed. If you have pushed, the only truly safe thing to do is git revert `SHAofBadCommit`(i.e. commit hash code ). That will create a new commit that undoes all the previous commit's changes. Or, if the branch you pushed to is rebase-safe (ie. other devs aren't expected to pull from it), you can just use `git push --force-with-lease`.

## I accidentally did a hard reset, and I want my changes back

If you accidentally do `git reset --hard`, you can normally still get your commit back, as git keeps a log of everything for a few days.

Note: This is only valid if your work is backed up, i.e., either committed or stashed. `git reset --hard` **will remove** uncommitted modifications, so use it with caution. (A safer option is `git reset --keep`.)

``(master)$ git reflog`

You'll see a list of your past commits, and a commit for the reset. Choose the SHA of the commit you want to return to, and reset again:

``(master)$ git reset --hard SHA1234`
And you should be good to go.

#### I staged too many edits, and I want to break them out into a separate commit

`git reset -p` will open a patch mode reset dialog. This is similar to `git add -p`, except that selecting "yes" will unstage the change, removing it from the upcoming commit.


#### I want to stage my unstaged edits, and unstage my staged edits

This is tricky. The best I figure is that you should stash your unstaged edits.

Then, reset.

After that, pop your stashed edits back.

And add them.

```
$ git stash -k
$ git reset --hard
$ git stash pop
$ git add -A
```
