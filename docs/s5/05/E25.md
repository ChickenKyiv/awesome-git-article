```
git diff                    # Show changes current working directory (not yet staged)
git diff --cached           # Show changes currently staged for commit
```


If you can recall, Git has an `index` between local repository and your working directory. So most of Git commands can either refer to `index` or the local repo. When you say **HEAD** in your Git command, it refers the `local repo`.

```
//  compare the working directory with local repository.
git diff HEAD [filename]

// compare the working directory with index.
git diff [filename]

// compare the index with local repository.
git diff --cached [filename]

```
