## Closing questions

Q: *do you have to do something else after?*

A git revert is just another commit, so e.g. push to the remote so that other users can pull/fetch/merge the changes and you're done.

---

Q: *Do you have to commit the changes revert made or does revert directly commit to the repo?*

git revert is a commit - there are no extra steps assuming reverting a single commit is what you wanted to do.

---

Q: *Obviously you'll need to push again and probably announce to the team.*

Indeed - if the remote is in an unstable state - communicating to the rest of the team that they need to pull to get the fix (the reverting commit) would be the right thing to do :).

And - you can revert a revert, where there are several new commits since the revert you're reverting.

So revert truly is just a commit of the opposite of the reverted commit. You might, of course, have conflicts ... but that's a different story.


Some people love to use revert with `-n` or `--no-commit` flag.

but it's matter of taste actually.

I prefer to have a commit, that can notify everyone what is going on.
