### Comparing branches

**Comparing two branches**

Branches are compared like all other ref inputs to git diff

`git diff branch1..other-feature-branch`

This example introduces the dot operator.

The two dots in this example indicate the diff input is the tips of both branches.

The same effect happens if the dots are omitted and a space is used between the branches.

---

Additionally, there is a three dot operator:


`git diff branch1...other-feature-branch`

The three dot operator initiates the diff by changing the first input parameter `branch1`.

It changes `branch1` into a ref of the shared common ancestor commit between the two diff inputs, the shared ancestor of `branch1` and `other-feature-branch`.

The last parameter input parameter remains unchanged as the tip of `other-feature-branch`.
