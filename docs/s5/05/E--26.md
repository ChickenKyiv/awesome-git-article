You can also compare files between two different commits. Every commit in Git has a commit id which you can get when you give git log. Then you can use the commit id if diff command like this.

`git diff 7eb2..e03 812...a3f35`

You can compare not just a single file, but all your changes at once.

If you made changes in many files, just donâ€™t mention any file name in the diff command which will diff all the changed files.


Let's explore previous mentioned options from this point of view(when you made changes in more than 5 files)

```
// compares working directory with index,
// i.e. shows the changes that are not staged yet.
git diff

// compares working directory with local repository.
// shows the list of changes after your last commit.
git diff HEAD

// compares index with local repository.
// shows the diff between your last commit and changes to be committed next.
git diff --cached
```
