If you can recall, Git has an `index` between local repository and your working directory.

So most of Git commands can either refer to `index` or the local repo.

When you say **HEAD** in your Git command, it refers the `local repo`.

Below is a list of most common uses of `git diff` command

```
git diff
# Show changes current working directory (not yet staged)


git diff HEAD [filename]
#  compare the working directory with local repository.


git diff [filename]
# compare the working directory with index.


git diff --cached
# Show changes currently staged for commit


git diff --cached [filename]
# compare the index with local repository.

```
