If your changes have already been pushed to a **public**, **shared remote**, and you want to revert all commits between `HEAD` and ``<sha-id>``, then you can pass a commit range to `git revert`,

`git revert 56e05f..HEAD`
and it will revert all commits between `56e05f` and `HEAD` (excluding the start point of the range, `56e05f`).

**Note that if you're reverting a few hundred commits, this could take a while because you have to commit each revert individually.**
