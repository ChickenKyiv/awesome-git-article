I think information from this course will help you pretty soon. Now you know more about different scenarios, that you can face as developer.



I'm pretty sure, that as you finished this course, you know more than most of developers that using git on daily basis.

When you just start to learn course you understand how to execute git commands, but right now you know when and how exactly to use them if you encounter some problems, for example.


Keep going and continue to advance your git skills - you'll be amazed with results!

Thank you for your time and hope you'll use this knowledge for better!

Good luck.
