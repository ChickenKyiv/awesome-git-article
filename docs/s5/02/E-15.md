#### I want to find by author/committer
To find all commits by author/committer you can use:

```
$ git log --author=<name or email>
$ git log --committer=<name or email>
```

Keep in mind that author and committer are not the same. The `--author` flag is the person who originally wrote the code; on the other hand, the `--committer`, is the person who committed the code on behalf of the original author.

#### I want to list commits containing specific files

To find all commits containing a specific file you can use:

`$ git log -- <path to file>`

You would usually specify an exact path, but you may also use wild cards in the path and file name:

`$ git log -- **/*.js`


While using wildcards, it's useful to inform `--name-status` to see the list of committed files:

`$ git log --name-status -- **/*.js`
