Check if all commits on a branch are merged

To check if all commits on a branch are merged into another branch, you should diff between the heads (or any commits) of those branches:

`(master)$ git log --graph --left-right --cherry-pick --oneline HEAD...feature/120-on-scroll`

This will tell you if any commits are in one but not the other, and will give you a list of any nonshared between the branches.

Another option is to do this:

`(master)$ git log master ^feature/120-on-scroll --no-merges`
