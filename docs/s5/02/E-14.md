#### I want to find a string in any commit

To find a certain string which was introduced in any commit, you can use the following structure:

`$ git log -S "string to find"`

Commons parameters:

`--source` means to show the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached.

`--all` means to start from every branch.

`--reverse` prints in reverse order, it means that will show the first commit that made the change.
