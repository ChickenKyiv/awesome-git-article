#### I want to discard specific unstaged changes

When you want to get rid of some, but not all changes in your working copy.

Checkout undesired changes, keep good changes.

```
$ git checkout -p
# Answer y to all of the snippets you want to drop
```

Another strategy involves using `stash`. Stash all the good changes, reset working copy, and reapply good changes.

```
$ git stash -p
# Select all of the snippets you want to save
$ git reset --hard
$ git stash pop
```

Alternatively, stash your undesired changes, and then drop stash.

```
$ git stash -p
# Select all of the snippets you don't want to save
$ git stash drop
```
