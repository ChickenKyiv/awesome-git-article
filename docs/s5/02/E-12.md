#### What did I just commit?
Let's say that you just blindly committed changes with git commit -a and you're not sure what the actual content of the commit you just made was. You can show the latest commit on your current HEAD with:

`(master)$ git show`
Or

`$ git log -n1 -p`

If you want to see a file at a specific commit, you can also do this (where `<commitid>` is the commit you're interested in):

`$ git show <commitid>:filename`
