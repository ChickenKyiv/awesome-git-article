#### I  want to checkout to a remote branch that someone else is working on
First, fetch all branches from remote:

`(master)$ git fetch --all`
Say you want to checkout to `daves` from the remote.

```
(master)$ git checkout --track origin/daves
Branch daves set up to track remote branch daves from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'daves'
```

(--track is shorthand for `git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch]`)

This will give you a local copy of the branch `daves`, and any update that has been pushed will also show up remotely.
