#### I committed with the wrong name and email configured
If it's a single commit, amend it

`$ git commit --amend --no-edit --author "New Authorname <authoremail@mydomain.com>"`

An alternative is to correctly configure your author settings in `git config --global author.(name|email)` and then use

`$ git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit`

#### I want to remove a file from the previous commit

In order to remove changes for a file from the previous commit, do the following:

```
$ git checkout HEAD^ myfile
$ git add myfile
$ git commit --amend --no-edit
```

In case the file was newly added to the commit and you want to remove it (from Git alone), do:

```
$ git rm --cached myfile
$ git commit --amend --no-edit
```

This is particularly useful when you have an open patch and you have committed an unnecessary file, and need to force push to update the patch on a remote. The `--no-edit` option is used to keep the existing commit message.
