What **git-revert** does is create a commit which undoes changes made in a given commit, creating a commit which is reverse (well, reciprocal) of a given commit. Therefore

`git revert <SHA-1>``
should and does work.

If you want to rewind back to a specified commit, and you can do this because this part of history was not yet published, you need to use git-reset, not git-revert:

`git reset --hard <SHA-1>`
(Note that `--hard` would make you lose any non-committed changes in the working directory).

{UPDATEEE}

**In the case that you're history has already been pushed to a remote before you did the hard reset, you would need to force push the newly reset branch with `git push -f`, but **Be Warned** that this could possibly unintentionally delete other users' commits, and if not delete new commits, then it will force other users to resynchronize their work with the reset branch, so make sure this is OK with your collaborators first.**
