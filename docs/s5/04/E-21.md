## I accidentally did a hard reset, and I want my changes back

If you accidentally do `git reset --hard`, you can normally still get your commit back, as git keeps a log of everything for a few days.

Note: This is only valid if your work is backed up, i.e., either committed or stashed.

`git reset --hard` **will remove** uncommitted modifications, so use it with caution.

(A safer option is `git reset --keep`.)

`(master)$ git reflog`

You'll see a list of your past commits, and a commit for the reset. Choose the SHA of the commit you want to return to, and reset again:

`(master)$ git reset --hard SHA1234`

And you should be good to go.
