You are working in a branch and you need a commit(e.g. a bug fix commit) from another branch to work in your current branch.

Then you can use `cherry-pick` command to get that commit in your current branch. It is also helpful if you committed in the wrong branch and want the commit in another branch.

First, you have to switch to the branch that has the commit. Copy the commit id of that commit and switch back to your own working branch. Then run the following command to get the commit in your working branch.


**`git cherry-pick` is like copying something from a folder and pasting it in another folder. So, it will not delete the commit from where you cherry picked and in destination branch commit id will also be different.**

`git cherry-pick <commit-id>`
