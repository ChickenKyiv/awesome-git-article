#### I staged too many edits, and I want to break them out into a separate commit

`git reset -p` will open a patch mode reset dialog. This is similar to `git add -p`, except that selecting "yes" will unstage the change, removing it from the upcoming commit.


#### I want to stage my unstaged edits, and unstage my staged edits

This is tricky. The best I figure is that you should stash your unstaged edits.

Then, reset.

After that, pop your stashed edits back.

And add them.

```
$ git stash -k
$ git reset --hard
$ git stash pop
$ git add -A
```
