 If you want to cherry pick more than one commit in one go, you can add their commit IDs separated by a space:

 `git cherry-pick d467740 de906d4`


 - If the cherry picking gets halted because of conflicts, resolve them and

 `git cherry-pick --continue`


 - If you want to bail of this step out altogether, just type:

 `git cherry-pick --abort`


 After all this is done, you can simply push the new commits to the upstream repo (e.g `origin`) and get on with your day.


**Note**
In case you needed to cherry pick a merge instead of a commit, you can use:

`git cherry-pick -m 1 <hash>`
