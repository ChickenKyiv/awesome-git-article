Letâ€™s say you are working in an project where you are making changes in a branch called `new-features`.

 You have already made a few commits but want to move just one of them into the master branch.

 - From new-features branch run `git log --oneline`  to get a better log of your commits history.
 Note that the commit hash is what we need to start the cherry picking.
 For example:

 - Checkout the branch where you want to cherry pick the specific commits. In this case `master` branch:

 `git checkout master`

 - Now we can cherry pick from `new-features` branch:

 `git cherry-pick d467740`

 This will cherry pick the commit with hash `d467740` and add it as a new commit on the master branch.

 **Note: it will have a new (and different) commit ID in the master branch.**

 If you want to cherry pick more than one commit in one go, you can add their commit IDs separated by a space:

 `git cherry-pick d467740 de906d4`

 - If the cherry picking gets halted because of conflicts, resolve them and

 `git cherry-pick --continue`

 - If you want to bail of this step out altogether, just type:

 `git cherry-pick --abort`

 After all this is done, you can simply push the new commits to the upstream repo (e.g `origin`) and get on with your day.

#### Tips n Tricks
In case you needed to cherry pick a merge instead of a commit, you can use:

`git cherry-pick -m 1 <hash>`
