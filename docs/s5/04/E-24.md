title: Cherry-pick. More cases
sidebar_label:
---

Letâ€™s say you are working in an project where you are making changes in a branch called `new-features`.

You have already made a few commits but want to move just one of them into the master branch.

 - From new-features branch run `git log --oneline`  to get a better log of your commits history.
 Note that the commit hash is what we need to start the cherry picking.


 For example:

 - Checkout the branch where you want to cherry pick the specific commits. In this case `master` branch:

 `git checkout master`

 - Now we can cherry pick from `new-features` branch:

 `git cherry-pick d467740`

 This will cherry pick the commit with hash `d467740` and add it as a new commit on the master branch.

 **Note: it will have a new (and different) commit ID in the master branch.**
