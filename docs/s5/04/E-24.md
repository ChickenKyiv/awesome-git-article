#### git revert makes a new commit

`git revert` simply creates a new commit that is the opposite of an existing commit.

It leaves the files in the same state as if the commit that has been reverted never existed. For example, consider the following simple example

```
$ cd /tmp/example
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/example/.git/
$ echo "Initial text" > README.md
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
[master (root-commit) 3f7522e] initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
$ echo "bad update" > README.md
$ git commit -am "bad update"
[master a1b9870] bad update
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
 ```

 In this example the commit history has two commits and the last one is a mistake. Using git revert:

```
 $ git revert HEAD
[master 1db4eeb] Revert "bad update"
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
 ```

There will be 3 commits in the log:

```
$ git log --oneline
1db4eeb Revert "bad update"
a1b9870 bad update
3f7522e initial commit
```
So there is a consistent history of what has happened, yet the files are as if the bad update never occured:
```
cat README.md
Initial text
```

It doesn't matter where in the history the commit to be reverted is (in the above example, the last commit is reverted - any commit can be reverted).
