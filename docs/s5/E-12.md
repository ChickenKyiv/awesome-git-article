You are working in a public repository and you want to undo a commit.

Then you can run the following command.

`git revert <commit-id> --no-commit`

After running the above command, you can check the affected files using `git status`.

Then you have to make a commit using `git commit -m "commit-message"`.

`git revert` **will not** `orphan` **a commit**.
**It will just undo the changes of your reverted commit id.**

Let’s assume you want to revert the last commit.

Then after reverting your status will look like following image.

Before the last commit **six.txt** file was not added,

so it is deleted and **five.txt** is changed back to it’s previous state.

Now, after committing your commit history will look like this.

You want to revert multiple commits within a range then you can run the following command.

`git revert <oldest-commit-id>..<recent-commit-id> --no-commit`

If you want to revert multiple commits that are not within

a range then you have to provide every commit id that you want to revert.

`git revert <commit-id-1> <commit-id-2> --no-commit`
