You want to discard your last some commits. Then you can use `git reset` to discard those commits. There are three flag for git reset that you should know.

Options for `git reset` are
- `--soft`
- `--mixed`
- `--hard`

Let’s assume you want to discard the changes until **added two.txt** which has commit id **96b037c**

Now, let’s run git reset command with `--soft flag.`

`git reset --soft 96b037c`

`git reset --soft` will make **orphan** all the commits after that commit id (e.g. **96b037c**) but the files will not be deleted.
The files will be in the staging area.

**Orphaned** commit means there is no direct path from a ref to access them. These orphaned commits can usually be found and restored using `git reflog` Git will permanently delete any orphaned commits after it runs the internal garbage collector.

**By default, git is configured to run the garbage collector every 30 days.**

So, if you run `git status` you will see the following output.

If you run `git log --oneline` you will see that previous commits are deleted.

If you run reset command with `--mixed` flag then your commits will be **orphaned** and the files will not be in staging area but the files will be found in the file system. If you don’t specify any flag in reset then git will use `--mixed` flag as default.

If you run `git status` then you will see the following output.

If you want to permanently delete the files then you can run reset command with `--hard` flag.

**A good practice you can follow that you first run reset command with `--soft` flag and see the affected files. If you are sure that you don’t want those changes then you can run the reset command with `--hard` flag.
**

You should never use `git reset <commit-id>` when any snapshots after **<commit-id>** have been pushed to a public repository.

Removing a commit that other team members have continued developing poses serious problems for collaboration.
