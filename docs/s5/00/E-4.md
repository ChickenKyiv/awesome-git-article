When learning git, you might find **HEAD** term.
**HEAD** is a reference to the last commit in the currently check-out branch. You can think of the HEAD as the "current branch".

When you switch branches with **git checkout**, the **HEAD** revision changes to point to the tip of the new branch.

#### Confirm the receiving branch

Execute `git status` to ensure that **HEAD** is pointing to the correct merge-receiving branch.

If needed, execute `git checkout <receiving branch>` to switch to the receiving branch.
