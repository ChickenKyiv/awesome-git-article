You can close corresponding issues using a keyword in your pull request or commit message.

**Close Git issue from commit**

The following keywords, followed by an issue number, will close the issue:

- `close`
- `closes`
- `closed`
- `fix`
- `fixes`
- `fixed`
- `resolve`
- `resolves`
- `resolved`

For example, to close an issue numbered 123,
you could use the phrase **"Closes #123"** or **"Closes: #123"** in your pull request description or commit message.

Once the branch is merged into the default branch, the issue will close.
