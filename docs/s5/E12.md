#### What did I just commit?
Let's say that you just blindly committed changes with git commit -a and you're not sure what the actual content of the commit you just made was. You can show the latest commit on your current HEAD with:

`(master)$ git show`
Or

`$ git log -n1 -p`

If you want to see a file at a specific commit, you can also do this (where `<commitid>` is the commit you're interested in):

`$ git show <commitid>:filename`

---

Check if all commits on a branch are merged
To check if all commits on a branch are merged into another branch, you should diff between the heads (or any commits) of those branches:

`(master)$ git log --graph --left-right --cherry-pick --oneline HEAD...feature/120-on-scroll`

This will tell you if any commits are in one but not the other, and will give you a list of any nonshared between the branches.

Another option is to do this:

`(master)$ git log master ^feature/120-on-scroll --no-merges`

---

#### I want to find a string in any commit

To find a certain string which was introduced in any commit, you can use the following structure:

`$ git log -S "string to find"`

Commons parameters:

`--source` means to show the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached.

`--all` means to start from every branch.

`--reverse` prints in reverse order, it means that will show the first commit that made the change.

---

#### I want to find by author/committer
To find all commits by author/committer you can use:

```
$ git log --author=<name or email>
$ git log --committer=<name or email>
```

Keep in mind that author and committer are not the same. The `--author` flag is the person who originally wrote the code; on the other hand, the `--committer`, is the person who committed the code on behalf of the original author.

---

#### I want to list commits containing specific files

To find all commits containing a specific file you can use:

`$ git log -- <path to file>`

You would usually specify an exact path, but you may also use wild cards in the path and file name:

`$ git log -- **/*.js`


While using wildcards, it's useful to inform `--name-status` to see the list of committed files:

`$ git log --name-status -- **/*.js`
