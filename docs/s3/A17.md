Before Mary have local GitHub repository and make some code changes at her PC


**4. Mary pushes the feature to her repository**

After her feature is complete, Mary pushes the feature branch to her own repository (not the official repository) with a simple `git push`:


`git push origin some-branch`
This makes her changes available to the project maintainer (or any collaborators who might need access to them).
