Welcome to course, where you'll learn about Pull Requests - an awesome collaboration concept for software developers.

When I prepared most slides, related to pull requests - I find out that this course is huge and I have a lot of information that I want to share with my students.

So I decided to split it into 2 parts.
This course is the first part.
I'll talk about theory and basic terms, related to pull requests.


You will learn the structure of the pull request and why to use them.

How pull requests work inside at GitHub.

How pull requests work with different git workflows such as forking workflow, feature branch workflow and gitflow.

Then I'll show you a default case, where few people collaborating with the same codebase at the same time.
