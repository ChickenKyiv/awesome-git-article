#### Tag your work in progress

With draft pull requests, you can clearly tag when you’re coding a work in progress.

Now when you open a pull request, a dropdown arrow appears next to the **“Create pull request”** button.
Toggle the dropdown arrow whenever you want to create a draft instead.





A draft pull request is styled differently to clearly indicate that it’s in a draft state.
Merging is blocked in draft pull requests.
Change the status to **“Ready for review”** near the bottom of your pull request to remove the draft state and allow merging according to your project’s settings.

Draft pull requests are ready for your code in public and open source repositories, as well as in private repositories as well.
