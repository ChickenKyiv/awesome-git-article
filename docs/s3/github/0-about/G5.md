Status checks are based on external processes, such as continuous integration builds, which run for each push you make to a repository.

You can see the pending, passing, or failing state of status checks next to individual commits in your pull request.

You can see the overall state of the last commit to a branch on your repository's branches page or in your repository's list of pull requests.




If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch.




There are two types of status checks on GitHub:

- Checks
- Statuses

Checks are different from statuses in that they provide line annotations, more detailed messaging, and are only available for use with GitHub Apps.

Organization owners and users with push access to a repository can create checks and statuses with GitHub's API.

But usually people using 3rd party-services that using checks.
For example you connecting Travis CI and it create a build with PR and have a check for creating a build without crashing.
