title: Requesting a PR review

You can request a review from either a suggested or specific person.

Suggested reviewers are based on `git blame` data.

If you request a review, other people with read access to the repository can still review your pull request.

Once someone has reviewed your pull request and you've made the necessary changes, you can re-request review from the same reviewer.

If the requested reviewer does not submit a review, and the pull request meets the repository's "mergeability" requirements, you can still merge the pull request.
