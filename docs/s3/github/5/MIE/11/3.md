You can resolve a conversation in a pull request if you opened the pull request or if you have write access to the repository where the pull request was opened.

To indicate that a conversation on the `Files changed` tab is complete, click `Resolve conversation`.

The entire conversation will be collapsed and marked as resolved,
making it easier to find conversations that still need to be addressed.

Tips:

**To toggle between collapsing and expanding all outdated review comments in a**
**pull request, hold down `alt` and click Show outdated or Hide outdated.**
