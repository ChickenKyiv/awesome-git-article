You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time.

While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes.

After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed.

This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review.

A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed.

After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or request additional changes by submitting your review with a summary comment.

**Tip: You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for review with the search qualifier** `review-requested:[USERNAME]` or `team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME]`.
