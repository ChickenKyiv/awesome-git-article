Before Mary created a Pull Request with her changes, located at forked feature branch

**6. John reviews the pull request**

John can access all of the pull requests people have filed by clicking on the Pull request tab in his own repository.

Clicking on Mary’s pull request will show him a description of the pull request, the feature’s commit history, and a diff of all the changes it contains.






If he thinks the feature is ready to merge into the project, all he has to do is hit the **Merge button** to approve the pull request and merge Mary’s feature into his `master` branch.

But, for this example, let’s say John found a small bug in Mary’s code, and needs her to fix it before merging it in.

He can either post a comment to the pull request as a whole, or he can select a specific commit in the feature’s history to comment on.
