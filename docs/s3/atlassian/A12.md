As each developer has their own public repository, the pull request’s source repository will differ from its destination repository.

The source repository is the developer’s public repository and the source branch is the one that contains the proposed changes.

If the developer is trying to merge the feature into the main codebase, then the destination repository is the official project and the destination branch is `master`.

Pull requests can also be used to collaborate with other developers outside of the official project.







For example, if a developer was working on a feature with a teammate, they could file a pull request using the teammate’s GitHub repository for the destination instead of the official project.






They would then use the same feature branch for the source and destination branches.
