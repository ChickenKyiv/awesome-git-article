In the Forking Workflow, a developer pushes a completed feature to their own public repository instead of a shared one.

After that, they file a pull request to let the project maintainer know that itâ€™s ready for review.

The notification aspect of pull requests is particularly useful in this workflow because the project maintainer has no way of knowing when another developer has added commits to their GitHub repository.
