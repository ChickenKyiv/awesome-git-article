Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository.

Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request.


Why I personally like pull request templates?
Because only robots and automatization can help me to not being lazy. Same thing for my repository contributors :)

When I introduced templates to my interns, it was cool to see how interns reacting to these changes.
It improved our processes a bit.

And saving my time, when I have a few pending pull requests

at different repositories and detailed description helping me to understand what was done.
