It wouldnâ€™t be sensible to use the same description template for different categories of pull requests.

For example, you may need to initiate a pull request for

submitting the code changes of a newly implemented feature, a simple bug fix,

documentation, or any kind of configuration work.


It would be best for each of these pull request links to load and pre-populate

different template contents in the description fields based on the submitted pull request category.
