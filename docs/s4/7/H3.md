As developers, our responsibility is not only to fix issues or implement new features,
but to clearly communicate the development work to reviewers.

A developer can convey proposed code changes and their purposes either through detailed documentation or other means of communication.

Hereâ€™s where the inevitable descriptions of pull or merge requests come into play,

where the code contributors share detailed comments on their code.
