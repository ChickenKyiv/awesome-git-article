GitHub provide a better way to create predefined templates for pull requests.

The template options offered allowing developers to share accurate details of
their proposed code changes at the start of the review process.

Providing clearer code descriptions makes the code review process easier,
which in turn helps achieve better code quality and limits the risks of unnoticed mistakes.

Once you take the time to create pull request templates in your repo,
you and your team can utilize them on an ongoing basis:

- saving you time
- decreasing context switching
- encouraging consistency
- increasing productivity.
