#### Scenario with commit

You just added a commit message and realized that there is a typo in your commit or you just want to make your commit message more expressive and understandable. Then you can use the following git command.

`git commit --amend -m "your-new-commit-message"``

If you just added some files or fixed a bug but donâ€™t want to add another commit message then you can use following git command with `--no-edit` flag.

`git commit --amend --no-edit`

**Here one thing is very important to remember that amending the last commit rewrites the commit history. It means your `commit id` will change when you amend a commit.**

If you already pushed your code in the remote repository and then you realized that you have to `amend` your commit message then after amending, you have to make a **force push**. Assuming your remote name as `origin` you can run the following command.

`git push origin <branch-name> -f`
