This is a quote from an experienced team leader(how he using pull requests):
> Generally I'm sanity checking. Does this look like code? Are there any obvious typos? Any residual debugging statements? Anything that feels like a mistake?

> If I want to get more involved, I'll pull the branch and test it. But sometimes it's better to get the code merged and fix bugs later, in smaller PRs.

> The longer a pull request is, the less likely the reviewer will catch anything of importance.

I put it into this slide in order to show you another side of creating pull requests. This is why for a lot of cases - I'm advising to have more pull requests with smaller changes rather than spend weeks on fixing something complex and then you open your PR and all development process are frozen, because this code is important but base branch went forward and it really hard to merge big chunk at one time.


We'll talk more about how project managers/team leaders/code reviewers thinks about pull requests in next slides
