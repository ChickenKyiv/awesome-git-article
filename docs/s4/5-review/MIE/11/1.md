You can comment on a pull request's `Conversation` tab to leave general comments, questions, or props.

You can also comment on specific sections of a file on a pull request's `Files changed` tab in the form of individual line comments or as part of a pull request review.

Adding line comments is a
great way to discuss questions about implementation or provide feedback to the author.

We talked about it before, when I explain to you a reviewing process.


**Note: If you reply to a pull request via email, your comment will be added on the Conversation tab and will not be part of a pull request review.**

To reply to an existing line comment, you'll need to navigate to the comment on either the `Conversation` tab
or `Files changed` tab and add an additional line comment below it.


**Tips:**

```
- Pull request comments support the same formatting as regular comments on GitHub,
such as @mentions, emoji, and references.
- You can add reactions to comments in pull requests in the Files changed tab.
```
