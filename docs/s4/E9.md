You want to switch to a branch. Then you can just run the following command.

`git checkout <branch-name>`

**If you already changed some file in your current branch, then be sure to `stash` your changes or `commit` the changes. . If you don’t `stash` or `commit` those changes, it will also reflect in your switched branch which you may not want or need.**

You have a branch name `development` and you want to make a branch from `development` and switch to your new branch directly. Then you can run the following command.

```
// (at development branch)
$ git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

You can also checkout using commit id. You can use shorthand commit id safely if your project isn’t very large.

`git checkout <commit-id>`

This will fall in **detached head state** in git.



**Head** is simply a reference to the current commit (latest) on the current branch.
Generally, **Head** in git can point to a branch or a commit.
When Head points to a branch, git doesn’t complain.

But when head points to a commit, but not a branch then it goes to a **detached head** state.



You want to develop a feature from this **detached head** state then you have to make a branch from this state and develop your feature there.

`git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>`
