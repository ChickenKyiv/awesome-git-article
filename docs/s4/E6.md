<!-- #### Scenario with branch -->

You have made a typo in your branch name or you want to change your branch name, then the following command will change your branch name.

`git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>`

You want to change the current branch name, then you can just run the following command.

`git branch -m <new-branch-name>`

If you’ve already pushed the branch with old name, then there are a couple of extra steps required. You need to delete the old branch from the remote and push up the new one.

```
git push <remote-name> --delete <old-branch-name>
git push <remote-name> <new-branch-name>
```

You want to push your local branch code but your local branch name doesn’t match with the name of remote repository branch name. Then you can run the following command.

`git push <remote-name> <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name>`

example:
`git push origin feature/account-page:release/dashboard`
