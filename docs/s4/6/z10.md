#### Story 9

I am not going to repeat what others have already said, but I will just add that it is sometimes important to ask the author to explain what he wanted to do and why.

Just because the code says it does something and it is properly executed, it does not mean it was what suppose to be done.

Make sure they actually understand what the task they are trying to do is about.
