#### Story 10

For long pull requests, I use a practice that I call "micro/macro reviewing"

#### Stage 1: Micro reviewing

- Find code that doesn't follow best practice (which formatters and linters don't catch). Make direct suggestions using Github web tool

- Find good code sections / good tests then publicly thank / praise the author


#### Stage 2: Macro reviewing


- Understand what the issue is about

- Read every changed files, ask myself if the change solves the issue or not, how it solves the issue.

Write down any questions that I have.

For files that I have no questions and be independent from other files, I fold it.

- Re-read every unfolded files to find answers for the noted questions.

Make a comment for anything that I can't find an answer or things that don't seem right.

- Beg for tests for non trivial changes.

- Find more good code sections / good tests then publicly thank / praise the author

- I hardly run the code myself.

Mostly because I'm lazy, but I trust code authors and our test suite.
