#### Story 1

When I did code reviews, and for any team I lead from a technical aspect for, my a review has three phases of confirmation:

#### Automatic

- Did the testing pass? If not, stop.
- Did the change add/remove tests? Why?
- Did the code quality decrease measurably?
- Did the change introduce possible future technical debt? Is it acceptable?
- Did any of the tooling indicate a decrease in maintainability or compliance?

#### Operation

- Does the change satisfy the statement of work submitted for the change?
- Does the change logic look reasonable?
- Can I follow the logic change in text, mentally, and not get lost.

#### Experience

- "From the end/admin/manager/etc users perspective does the change function as expected?"

Sure it seems like a lot, and yes it may slow down
the merge process a bit.

But in my experience taking a little longer to review code
can help prevent issues from getting to production.

The holy grain though is a 100% automated process
with confidence in the automation that when a change begins
throwing errors the changes are rolled back,
the errors logged, and the committing developer alerted.
