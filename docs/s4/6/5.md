+1 to "Ask Questions".

Not only from the perspective of giving the author a chance
to explain why they chose the path they took,
but also from the perspective of a reviewer trying to learn,
as well as a mechanism for prompting discussion.

I've learned a ton asking questions in PR

(ex: "oh, so you can define a nested class in this language?", etc),

 but I've also used it with great effect to guide a more
 junior dev to realize ways they could improve their code and
 understand the "why" of one approach to solving a problem being better than another

 (ex: "so if we had to change this value here, what else would have to change?"

 or "if this value was null here, what would happen in the subsequent lines that follow?", etc
 )

 IE "ask don't tell" can be an effective review technique for avoiding putting the author on the defensive.
