**Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.**

Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.

Usually, the changes are on different lines, or even in different files, which makes the merge simple for computers to understand.

However, sometimes there are competing changes that Git can't resolve without your help.


Often, merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
