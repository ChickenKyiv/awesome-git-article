Here I decide to paste a great comment from cool developer that i'm following(about managing merge conflicts):

> I feel that this is a simple and solid approach that's often overlooked:

> 1. Commit your code when anything is worth saving.
> 2. Do not push it yet. Instead, 'git pull origin master'.
> 3. If there is an existing conflict, it should be minor. Resolve it.
> 4. Then, commit with -m 'Resolved merge conflict'.
> 5. Then - again - 'git pull origin master' to guarantee you have the latest.
> 6. Rinse, repeat steps 3-5 until you get a clean pull.
> 7. Push your branch.

> No matter how long the life of your branch is, it's now being bookmarked with local commits, and then merged with origin/master to avoid a future conflict (aka trainwreck.)

> In my experience, Atom (Merge Conflict/Split Diff) and VS Code (GitLens) have nice packages/extensions for Git in general. I would always advise learning git via CLI vs a GUI, since pressing a button is way different from typing commands with the intention of accomplishing something specific.
