title: Squash and merge your pull request commits
sidebar_label:

When you select the `Squash and merge` option on a pull request on GitHub, the pull request's
commits are squashed into a single commit.

Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch,

the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch.

Pull requests with squashed commits are merged using the **fast-forward** option.

You can read more details about fast forward merge at link below
