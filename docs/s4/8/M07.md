Merging and conflicts are a common part of the Git experience.

Conflicts can be costly and time-consuming.

But Git makes merging super easy.

Most of the time, Git will figure out how to automatically integrate new changes.

Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it.

In these cases, Git cannot automatically determine what is correct.

Conflicts only affect the developer conducting the merge, the rest of the team is unaware of the conflict.

Git will mark the file as being conflicted and halt the merging process.

It is then the developers' responsibility to resolve the conflict.


For a lot of people, merge conflicts are as scary as accidentally formatting their hard drive.

I want to relieve you from this fear in the next few slides.

Again, merge conflicts happen to everyone! So it's just part of a process, don't worry - you just need more practice and you'll get it.
