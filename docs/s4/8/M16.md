To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing changes to a file, where a person deletes a file in one branch and another person edits the same file, you must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new commit.

For example, if you edited a file, such as `README.md`, and another person removed the same file in another branch in the same Git repository,

you'll get a merge conflict error when you try to merge these branches.

You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.



1. Open the terminal.

2. Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.

`$ cd REPOSITORY-NAME`

3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict. In this example, the file `README.md` has a merge conflict.

`$ git status`

```
> # On branch master
> # Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
> # and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
> #  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
> # You have unmerged paths.
> #  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
> #
> # Unmerged paths:
> #  (use "git add/rm ..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
> #
> #	deleted by us:   README.md
> #
> # no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

4. Open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.

5. Decide if you want keep the removed file. You may want to view the latest changes made to the removed file in your text editor.

To add the removed file back to your repository:

`$ git add README.md`

To remove this file from your repository:

```
$ git rm README.md
> README.md: needs merge
> rm 'README.md'
```

6. Commit your changes with a comment.

```
$ git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict by keeping README.md file."
> [branch-d 6f89e49] Merge branch 'branch-c' into branch-d
```

Now you can merge your changes or push changes to GitHub and merge them later in a pull request.
