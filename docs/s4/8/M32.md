I think information from this course will help you in future to understand better how to collaborate with your team members.

Communication is the biggest problem in software development teams.


I know it because I'm mixing work as a developer, as project manager and github repository maintainer.
This course contains most important information that I was able to prepare.
I'm glad you complete it. Keep going!


Pull requests is a great separated space, that will give you a lot of features, that focused on productivity and will help you to create better software.


Thank you for your time and hope you'll use this knowledge for better!

Good luck.
