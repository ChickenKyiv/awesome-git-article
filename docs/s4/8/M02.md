#### You can merge pull requests by retaining all the commits in a feature branch, squashing all commits into a single commit, or by rebasing individual commits from the head branch onto the base branch.

When you click the default `Merge pull request` option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit.

The pull request is merged using the `--no-ff` option.

To merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository.
