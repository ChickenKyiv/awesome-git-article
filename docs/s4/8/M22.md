<!-- Reverting a pull request -->

#### You can revert a pull request after it's been merged to the upstream branch.

Reverting a pull request on GitHub creates a new pull request that contains one revert of the merge commit from the original merged pull request.

Note: You may need to use Git to manually revert the individual commits if:

- Reverting the pull request causes merge conflicts
- The original pull request **was not** originally merged on GitHub (for example, using a fast-forward merge on the command line)


1. Under your repository name, click  `Pull requests`.
