You can merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed.

Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge.

At this section we'll talk about 3 major parts

1) About pull request merges

2) Squash and merge your pull request commits

3) Rebase and merge your pull request commits


Later we'll also touch this topics as well
- Deleting branches in a pull request
- Restoring a deleted branch
- Reverting a pull request
- Closing a pull request
- Checking out pull requests locally
- Addressing merge conflicts
- About merge conflicts
- Resolving a merge conflict on GitHub
- Resolving a merge conflict using the command line
