sidebar_label: Gitflow Workflow With Pull Requests

The Gitflow Workflow is similar to the Feature Branch Workflow, but defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.

Adding pull requests to the Gitflow Workflow gives developers a convenient place to talk about a release branch or a maintenance branch while theyâ€™re working on it.

The mechanics of pull requests in the Gitflow Workflow are the exact same as the previous section:
1) a developer simply files a pull request
2) PR contain a feature, release, or hotfix branch
3) PR should be reviewed before merge
4) The rest of the team will be notified via GitHub notification/email.



Features are generally merged into the develop branch, while `release` and `hotfix` branches are merged into both `develop` and `master`.

Pull requests can be used to formally manage all of these merges.
