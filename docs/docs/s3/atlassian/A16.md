Before Mary forked a GitHub repository and cloned it locally

**3. Mary develops a new feature**


Before she starts writing any code, Mary needs to create a new branch for her feature.

This branch is what she will use as the source branch of the pull request.

`git checkout -b some-feature`

**# Edit some code**

`git commit -a -m "Add first draft of some feature"`

Mary can use as many commits as she needs to create the feature.

And, if the feature’s history is messier than she would like, she can use an interactive rebase to remove or squash unnecessary commits.

For larger projects, cleaning up a feature’s history makes it much easier for the project maintainer to see what’s going on in the pull request.
