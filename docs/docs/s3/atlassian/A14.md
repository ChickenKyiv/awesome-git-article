The example below demonstrates how pull requests can be used in the Forking Workflow.

It is equally applicable to developers working in small teams and to a third-party developer contributing to an open source project.




In the example, Mary is a developer, and John is the project maintainer.
Both of them have their own public repositories, and John’s contains the official project.







**1. Mary forks the official project**

<!-- Pull Requests: Fork the project -->


To start working in the project, Mary first needs to fork John’s  repository.




She can do this by signing in to Github(if she don't have an account), navigating to John’s repository, and clicking the Fork button.



In a few seconds/minutes she will have a server-side copy of the project.
