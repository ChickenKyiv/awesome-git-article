**Note: When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:**

If you're working in the shared repository model, we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request.

While you can send pull requests from any branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you need to update your proposed changes.

When pushing commits to a pull request, don't force push.

**! Force pushing can corrupt your pull request.**

After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch.

You can:
- add a summary of the proposed changes
- review the changes made by commits
- add labels, milestones
- add assignees
- use **@mention** to send notification to individual contributors or teams inside of GitHub.
- start some 3rd party service checks and get some recommendation for your code changes
