Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request.

These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the "Files changed" tab.

Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request.

You can see information about the branch's current deployment status and past deployment activity on the "Conversation" tab.
