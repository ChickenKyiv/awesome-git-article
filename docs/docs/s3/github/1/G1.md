At this section of our course we'll dive deeper in Pull Requests and how use them at GitHub.com.

- Pull Requests Intro

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
