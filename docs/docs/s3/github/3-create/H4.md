When thinking about branches, remember that the `base` branch is where changes should be applied, the `HEAD` branch contains what you would like to be applied.

When you change the `base` repository, you also change notifications for the pull request.

Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.

When you change any of the information in the branch range, the `Commit` and `Files` changed preview areas will update to show your new range.

**Tips:

Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe.***
