If you are a developer and you want to get started with Git and GitHub, then this course is made for you.

After a short introduction on what is Git and how to use it, you will be able to create and work on a GitHub project.

## What is Git?
Git is a free and open source software created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.

Many control systems exist, like CVS, SVN, Mercurial and others, but today Git is the standard software for version control.

> As of 2018, almost 90% of the 74,000 developers surveyed by Stack Overflow prefer to use Git for version control. Git dominates all other version control systems and adoption is up almost 20% from 2017 according to the survey. However, Git has not always been this ubiquitous. Letâ€™s take a look at its ascent into mass popularity.
