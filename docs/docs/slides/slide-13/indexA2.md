Before we go to some examples of git merge I want touch a surface of git-flow workflow.
It's another big and important topic, for mastering git.
I'll advice you to research it on your own later


Below is an example of how may look a simple git-flow branches tree.

all of this - branches names, (yes you can put / into your branch name. it's like a directory on your computer. easy to understand and navigate).
It'll require some practice, in order to incorporate git-flow into your coding process, but it will really help you with processes like `git merge`, `git rebase` and other.
