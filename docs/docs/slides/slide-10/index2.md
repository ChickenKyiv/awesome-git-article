**“commit”**: Now that we have added the files of our choice, we need to write a message to explain what we have done. This message may be useful later if we want to check the change history. Here is an example of what we can put in our case.

<!-- `$ git commit -m "Added README.md with good description in it."` -->

Let's add our readme file into git history.

As you may create another file as I did, let's commit it to git repository as well(If you previously add it to git)

Below you can see an output from **git status** if you run it after committing your files

**“push”**: You’re there, you can now put your work online! If you type the following command, all your work will be put online and visible directly on the repository page.

You did it! If you come back on your repository page on GitHub, you are going to your “README.md” file with a beautiful preview of it.
