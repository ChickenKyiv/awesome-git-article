If you are new in the development world, these words will not tell you anything. However, don’t worry after this short paragraph, you will exactly know what a “Version Control System (VCS)” is.

Version control is a management system that takes into consideration modifications you’ve made on a file or a set of files (example: a code project). With this system, developers can collaborate and work together on the same project.

A branch system is carried by version control and allow developers to work individually on a task (example: One branch, one task or one branch, one developer) before to combine all changes made by the collaborators into the main branch.

All changes made by developers are traced and saved in a history. It can be beneficial to track modifications made by every collaborator.
