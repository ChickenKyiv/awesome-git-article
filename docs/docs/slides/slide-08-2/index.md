Two major processes working with git and version control systems are:

**Check-Out**: make a copy of the repository you wanted to.
Make changes locally, then once you have made your changes, Check-In your changes.

**Check-In**: add your changes back to the repository with an detailed explanation message about change you have made.

GitHub doing it with more steps, but logic is same
1) Clone the repository
2) Make changes
3) Commit changes with a message about changes
4) Push changes back to the GitHub Repository

Documentation at GitHub are fantastic and I advice you to use it frequently. Part of my information for this course are actually organized information from GitHub.


When you open your folder with repository(we don't have it yet, but in future), you will see a **.git** folder. It's like a history database, that store all changes, that was made at this repository.

There a few, very similar Git CheetShets, I provide a links to them here, you may use one, that is more suitable for you.
You can also print some data and keep it on your table, so it will be more easy to remember commands that we'll learn here
