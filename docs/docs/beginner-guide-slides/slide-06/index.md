#### Slide 7: Create clean code repository on Github

##1 step — Time to start!
Looking forward to getting started? Let’s do it!

This first exercise is not very complicated; it’s divided into two steps. The Git installation and GitHub account creation.

To create your account, you need to connect on the main GitHub page and to fill in the registration form.

Nothing more! You are officially a new member of GitHub!
