<!-- Git Flow Workflow - Release Branches -->


Once `develop` has acquired enough features for a release (or a predetermined release date is approaching), you fork a release branch off of `develop`.

Creating this branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this pointâ€”only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch.

Once it's ready to ship, the `release` branch gets merged
into `master` and tagged with a version number.

In addition, it should be merged back into `develop`, which may have progressed since the release was initiated.
