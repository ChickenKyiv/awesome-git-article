Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration.
But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch.
When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop.
Features should never interact directly with master.




<!-- Git flow workflow - Feature Branches -->



Note that feature branches combined with the develop branch is, for all intents and purposes, the Feature Branch Workflow.

But, the Gitflow Workflow doesnâ€™t stop there.

Feature branches are generally created off to the latest develop branch.

Creating a feature branch
Without the git-flow extensions:

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature_branch
```

When using the git-flow extension:

```
git flow feature start feature_branch
```

Continue your work and use Git like you normally would.
