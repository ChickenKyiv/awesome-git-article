<!-- Git flow workflow - Hotfix Branches -->


Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly patch production releases.

Hotfix branches are a lot like release branches and feature branches except they're based on master instead of develop.

This is the only branch that should fork directly off of master.

As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both master and develop (or the current release branch), and master should be tagged with an updated version number.




Having a dedicated line of development for bug fixes lets your team address issues without interrupting the rest of the workflow or waiting for the next release cycle.

You can think of maintenance branches as ad hoc release branches that work directly with master.

A hotfix branch can be created using the following methods:


Without the git-flow extensions:

```
git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix_branch
```

When using the git-flow extensions:

```
$ git flow hotfix start hotfix_branch
```

Similar to finishing a release branch, a hotfix branch gets merged into both master and develop.



```
git checkout master
git merge hotfix_branch
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix_branch
git branch -D hotfix_branch
$ git flow hotfix finish hotfix_branch
```
