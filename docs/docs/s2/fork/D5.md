When they're ready to publish a local commit, they push the commit to their own public repositoryâ€”not the official one.

Then, they file a pull request with the main repository, which lets the project maintainer know that an update is ready to be integrated.

The pull request also serves as a convenient discussion thread if there are issues with the contributed code.
The following is a step-by-step example of this workflow.





A developer 'forks' an 'official' server-side repository. This creates their own server-side copy.

The new server-side copy is cloned to their local system.
A Git remote path for the 'official' repository is added to the local clone.

A new local feature branch is created.

The developer makes changes on the new branch.
New commits are created for the changes.

The branch gets pushed to the developer's own server-side copy.

The developer opens a pull request from the new branch to the 'official' repository.

The pull request gets approved for merge and is merged into the original server-side repository
