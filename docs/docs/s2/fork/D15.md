The Forking Workflow helps a maintainer of a project open up the repository to contributions from any developer without having to manually manage authorization settings for each individual contributor.
This gives the maintainer more of a "pull" style workflow.

Most commonly used in open-source projects, the Forking Workflow can also be applied to private business workflows to give more authoritative control over what is merged into a release.
This can be useful in teams that have Deploy Managers or strict release cycles.
