<!-- Git Fork Workflow - Making a pull request -->

Once a developer is ready to share their new feature, they need to do two things.

First, they have to make their contribution accessible to other developers by pushing it to their public repository.
 Their origin remote should already be set up, so all they should have to do is the following:

`git push origin feature-branch`

This diverges from the other workflows in that the origin remote points to the developer’s personal server-side repository, not the main codebase.


Second, they need to notify the project maintainer that they want to merge their feature into the official codebase.

GitHub provides a “pull request” button that leads to a form asking you to specify which branch you want to merge into the official repository.

Typically, you’ll want to integrate your feature branch into the upstream remote’s master branch.
