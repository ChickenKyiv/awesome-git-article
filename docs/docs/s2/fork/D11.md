#### Adding a remote

Whereas other Git workflows use a single origin remote that points to the central repository, the Forking Workflow requires two remotes—one for the official repository, and one for the developer’s personal server-side repository.

While you can call these remotes anything you want, a common convention is to use origin as the remote for your forked repository (this will be created automatically when you run git clone) and upstream for the official repository.

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/maintainer/repo`

You’ll need to create the upstream remote yourself using the above command.
This will let you easily keep your local repository up-to-date as the official project progresses.
Note that if your upstream repository has authentication enabled (i.e., it's not open source), you'll need to supply a username, like so:

`git remote add upstream https://user@host/maintainer/repo.git`

This requires users to supply a valid password before cloning or pulling from the official codebase.
