To recap, the Forking Workflow is commonly used in public open-source projects.

Forking is a git clone operation executed on a server copy of a projects repo.

A Forking Workflow is often used in conjunction with a Git hosting service like GitHub.


A high-level example of a Forking Workflow is:














- You want to contribute to an open source library hosted at bitbucket.org/userA/open-project
- Using Bitbucket you create a fork of the repo to bitbucket.org/YourName/open-project

- On your local system you execute git clone on https://bitbucket.org/YourName/open-project to get a local copy of the repo




- You create a new feature branch in your local repo

- Work is done to complete the new feature and `git commit` is executed to save the changes

- You then push the new feature branch to your remote forked repo




- Using Bitbucket you open up a pull request for the new branch against the original repo at bitbucket.org/userA/open-project
