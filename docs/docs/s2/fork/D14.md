To recap, the Forking Workflow is commonly used in public open-source projects.

Forking is a git clone operation executed on a server copy of a projects repo.

A Forking Workflow is often used in conjunction with a Git hosting service like GitHub.


A high-level example of a Forking Workflow is:


- You want to contribute to an open source library hosted at `github.com/userName/open-project-repository`
- Using GitHub you create a fork of the repo to `github.com/YourName/open-project-repository`

- On your local system you execute
```
git clone on https://github.com/YourName/open-project-repository
```
to get a local copy of the repo




- You create a new `feature` branch in your local repo

- Work is done to complete the new feature and `git commit` is executed to save the changes

- You then push the new `feature` branch to your remote forked repo



- Using GitHub you open up a pull request for the new branch against the original repo at `github.com/userName/open-project-repository`
