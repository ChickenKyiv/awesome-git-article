#### Branching in the Forking Workflow
All of these personal public repositories are really just a convenient way to share branches with other developers.

Everybody should still be using branches to isolate individual features, just like in the Feature Branch Workflow and the Gitflow Workflow.
The only difference is how those branches get shared. In the Forking Workflow, they are pulled into another developerâ€™s local repository, while in the Feature Branch and Gitflow Workflows they are pushed to the official repository.
