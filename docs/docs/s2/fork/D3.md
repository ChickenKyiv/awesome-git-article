The Forking Workflow typically follows a branching model based on the Gitflow Workflow.
This means that complete feature branches will be purposed for merge into the original project maintainer's repository.
The result is a distributed workflow that provides a flexible way for large, organic teams (including untrusted third-parties) to collaborate securely. This also makes it an ideal workflow for open source projects.
