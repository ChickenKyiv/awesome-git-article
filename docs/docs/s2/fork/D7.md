It's important to note that "forked" repositories and "forking" are not special operations.

Forked repositories are created using the standard `git clone` command.

Forked repositories are generally "server-side clones" and usually managed and hosted by a 3rd party Git service like GitHub.

There is no unique Git command to create forked repositories.
A clone operation is essentially a copy of a repository and its history.
