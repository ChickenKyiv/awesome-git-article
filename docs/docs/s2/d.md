<!-- ## Gitflow Workflow -->

The Gitflow Workflow was first published in a highly regarded 2010 blog post from Vincent Driessen at nvie.

The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.

This workflow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands beyond what’s required for the Feature Branch Workflow.

Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact.
