<!-- #### Guidelines -->

There is no one size fits all Git workflow.

As previously stated, it’s important to develop a Git workflow that is a productivity enhancement for your team.

In addition to team culture, a workflow should also complement business culture.

Git features like branches and tags should complement your business’s release schedule.

If your team is using task tracking project management software you may want to use branches that correspond with tasks in progress.
