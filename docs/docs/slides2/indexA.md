﻿<!-- #### Comparing Workflows -->


A Git Workflow is a recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner.

When working with a team on a Git managed project, it’s important to make sure the team is all in agreement on how the flow of changes will be applied. To ensure the team is on the same page, an agreed upon Git workflow should be developed or selected.

There are several publicized Git workflows that may be a good fit for your team.
