<!-- #### What is a successful Git workflow? -->

When evaluating a workflow for your team, it's most important that you consider your teamâ€™s culture.

You want the workflow to enhance the effectiveness of your team and not be a burden that limits productivity.
Some things to consider when evaluating a Git workflow are:

- Does this workflow scale with team size?

- Is it easy to undo mistakes and errors with this workflow?

- Does this workflow impose any new unnecessary cognitive overhead to the team?
