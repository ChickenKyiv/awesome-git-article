Compared to other collaboration models, this formal solution for sharing commits makes for a much more streamlined workflow.

SVN and Git can both automatically send notification emails with a simple script; however, when it comes to discussing changes, developers typically have to rely on email threads.

This can become haphazard, especially when follow-up commits are involved.

Pull requests put all of this functionality into a friendly web interface right next to your GitHub repositories.
