Before Mary push her code changes at GitHub

#### 5. Mary creates the pull request
<!-- Pull Request: Create Pull Request -->



After GitHub has her feature branch, Mary can create the pull request through her GitHub account by navigating to her forked repository and clicking the `Pull request` button.





The resulting form automatically sets Mary’s repository as the source repository, and it asks her to specify the source branch, the destination repository, and the destination branch.

Mary wants to merge her feature into the main codebase, so a) the source branch is her feature branch
b) the destination repository is John’s public repository
c) the destination branch is master in John's public repository.

She’ll also need to provide a title and description for the pull request.

If there are other people who need to approve the code besides John, she can add them in the Reviewers sidebar.





<!-- Pull Request: github -->



After she creates the pull request, a notification will be sent to John via his GitHub feed and (optionally) via email.
