Before Mary forked a GitHub repository

**2. Mary clones her GitHub repository**





Next, Mary needs to clone the GitHub repository that she just forked.
This will give her a working copy of the project on her local machine.
She can do this by running the following command:


`git clone https://user@host/user/repo.git`



Keep in mind that `git clone` automatically creates an origin remote that points back to Maryâ€™s forked repository.
Not to an official repository


At next part we'll talk about making code changes and what Mary will do next
