In their simplest form, pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature.

Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their GitHub account.

- This lets everybody involved know about your changes
- They may need to review the code
- Your changes can be merged into the master branch
 or merged at other branches as well.


The pull request is more than just a notification tool.
Itâ€™s a dedicated forum for discussing the proposed feature code changes.

If repository maintainer or code reviewers decide that you need to make some additional changes
- or your code just have some bugs
- teammates can post questions or feedback into your PR
- teammates can tweak code of this feature by pushing a follow-up commits


All of this activity is tracked directly inside of the pull request.

Below are two examples of collaboration via Pull Requests.
