When you file a pull request, all youâ€™re doing is requesting that another developer (e.g., the project maintainer) pulls a branch from your repository into their repository.

This means that you need to provide 4 pieces of information to file a pull request:
- the source repository
- the source branch
- the destination repository
- the destination branch.
