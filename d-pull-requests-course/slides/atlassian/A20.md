John is requesting to some changes, before he will merge a pull request into main codebase
<!-- Pull Request: Comment -->

6. Mary adds a follow-up commit

If Mary has any questions about the feedback, she can respond inside of the pull request, treating it as a discussion forum for her feature.






To correct the error, Mary adds another commit to her feature branch and pushes it to her GitHub repository, just like she did the first time around.


This commit is automatically added to the original pull request, and John can review the changes again, right next to his original comment.

7. John accepts the pull request
Finally, John accepts the changes, merges the feature branch into master, and closes the pull request.

The feature is now integrated into the project, and any other developers working on it can pull it into their own local repositories using the standard `git pull` command.
