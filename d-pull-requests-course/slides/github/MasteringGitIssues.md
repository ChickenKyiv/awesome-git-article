Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. 
They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. 
Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. 
GitHub’s tracker is called **Issues**, and has its own section in every repository.

For example, let’s take a look at Bootstrap’s Issues section:

GitHub’s issue tracking is special because of our focus on collaboration, references, and excellent text formatting. A typical issue on GitHub looks a bit like this:

example-issue

- A **title** and **description** describe what the issue is all about.

- **Color-coded labels** help you categorize and filter your issues (just like labels in email).

- A milestone acts like a container for issues. 
This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases (e.g. **Weekly Sprint 9/5-9/16** or **Shipping 1.0**).

- One assignee is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.

- Comments allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.

## Milestones, Labels, and Assignees

Once you’ve collected a lot of issues, you may find it hard to find the ones you care about. 
**Milestones**, **labels**, and **assignees** are great features to filter and categorize issues.

You can change or add a milestone, an assignee, and labels by clicking their corresponding gears in the sidebar on the right.



If you don’t see edit buttons, that’s
because you don’t have permission to edit the issue.
You can ask the repository owner to add you as a collaborator to get access.

#### Milestones
milestones
Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. People use them in many different ways in software development. Some examples of milestones on GitHub include:

- **Beta Launch** — File bugs that you need to fix before you can launch the beta of your project. 
It’s a great way to make sure you aren’t missing anything.

- **October Sprint** — File issues that you’d like to work on in October. 
A great way to focus your efforts when there’s a lot to do.

- **Redesign** — File issues related to redesigning your project. 
A great way to collect ideas on what to work on.
