Changing the branch range and destination repository

By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch.

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists.

You can also swap your `head` and `base` branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points.

References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.
