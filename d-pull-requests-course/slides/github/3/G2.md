You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request.

Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.

**Note: To open a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch or, for organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open a pull request.**

As you remember, you can close corresponding issues using a keyword in your pull request or commit message.
