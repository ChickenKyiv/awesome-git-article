Marking a request as a draft allows the developer to highlight to other collaborators that their code is a work-in-progress and requires feedback before being integrated into the main project.


So, suppose a developer has been trying to solve a difficult problem.

They could, in essence, create a “minimum viable product” that solves the problem, but isn’t quite ready to be deployed.


By marking the pull request as a draft, they can start a conversation about their solution with their teammates without necessarily compromising the quality of the main codebase.


Developers can mark a pull request as a draft simply by clicking a drop-down menu on the site.
It’s worth noting that draft requests cannot be merged with the main codebase.

This is likely to prevent developers from accidentally integrating unfinished code with master branch.
