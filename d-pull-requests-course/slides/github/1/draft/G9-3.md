But what if you want to signal that a pull request is just the start of the conversation and your code isn’t in any state to be judged?

Perhaps the code is for a hackathon project.

You have no intention of ever merging it, but you’d still like people to check it out locally and give you feedback.

Or perhaps you’ve opened a pull request without any code at all in order to get the discussion started.
