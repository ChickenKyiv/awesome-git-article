#### Changing the stage of a pull request.

You can mark a draft pull request as ready for review.

Pull request authors and anyone with write permissions for the repository can mark a draft pull request as ready for review.

When you're ready to get feedback on your draft pull request, you can mark your pull request as ready for review. If the author is unavailable for any reason, anyone with write access to the repository can mark the pull request as ready for review. Then, the pull request can be merged, and code owners will be requested to review the pull request.

- Under your repository name, click  **Pull requests**.
- In the **"Pull requests"** list, click the pull request you'd like to mark as ready for review.
- On the **"Conversation"** tab, scroll to the merge box, then click Ready for review. Anyone with write access to the repository can also click Ready for review if the author is unavailable.
