Repository administrators now have a few options to choose from when deciding how to handle history.


**1. Allow merge commits and commit squashing**

This option will leave the decision to create a merge commit or squash up to the user doing the merging.

This lets repository administrators stay flexible when deciding whether or not to retain all history from a feature branch.


**2. Only allow merge commits**

This is the default behavior and is exactly how the merge button worked before this change.

Collaborators wonâ€™t have the option to squash their commits via the merge button.


**3. Only allow squash commits**

This is a new option which lets you force commit squashing on all pull requests merged via the merge button.
