#### Draft pull requests

Marking a request as a draft allows the developer to highlight to other collaborators that their code is a work-in-progress and requires feedback before being integrated into the main project.


So, suppose a developer has been trying to solve a difficult problem.

They could, in essence, create a “minimum viable product” that solves the problem, but isn’t quite ready to be deployed.

By marking the pull request as a draft, they can start a conversation about their solution with their teammates without necessarily compromising the quality of the main codebase.


Developers can mark a pull request as a draft simply by clicking a drop-down menu on the site.
It’s worth noting that draft requests cannot be merged with the main codebase.
This is likely to prevent fat-fingered users from accidentally integrating unfinished code with master branch.

Making the jump from ones tentative first steps with code into working with a team on an important project can often appear intimidating.

Draft pull requests are a great way to bridge that gap, allowing journeymen developers to contribute and gain feedback, without potentially harming a project.

But what if you want to signal that a pull request is just the start of the conversation and your code isn’t in any state to be judged?

Perhaps the code is for a hackathon project.

You have no intention of ever merging it, but you’d still like people to check it out locally and give you feedback.

Or perhaps you’ve opened a pull request without any code at all in order to get the discussion started.



#### Tag your work in progress

With draft pull requests, you can clearly tag when you’re coding a work in progress.

Now when you open a pull request, a dropdown arrow appears next to the **“Create pull request”** button.
Toggle the dropdown arrow whenever you want to create a draft instead.





A draft pull request is styled differently to clearly indicate that it’s in a draft state.
Merging is blocked in draft pull requests.
Change the status to **“Ready for review”** near the bottom of your pull request to remove the draft state and allow merging according to your project’s settings.






Draft pull requests are ready for your code in public and open source repositories, as well as in private repositories as well.

#### Draft pull requests



When you create a pull request, you can choose to create a pull request that is ready for review or a draft pull request.

Draft pull requests cannot be merged, and code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests.



**For more information about creating a draft pull request, see "Creating a pull request" and "Creating a pull request from a fork."**



When you're ready to get feedback on your draft pull request, you can mark your pull request as ready for review.

If the author is unavailable for any reason, anyone with write access to the repository can mark the pull request as ready for review.

Then, the pull request can be merged, and code owners will be requested to review the pull request.
**For more information, see "Changing the stage of a pull request."**
