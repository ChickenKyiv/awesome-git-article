When you create a pull request, you can choose to create a pull request that is ready for review or a draft pull request.

Draft pull requests cannot be merged, and code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests.

**For more information about creating a draft pull request, see "Creating a pull request" and "Creating a pull request from a fork."**

When you're ready to get feedback on your draft pull request, you can mark your pull request as ready for review.

If the author is unavailable for any reason, anyone with write access to the repository can mark the pull request as ready for review.

Then, the pull request can be merged, and code owners will be requested to review the pull request.

**For more information, see "Changing the stage of a pull request."**
