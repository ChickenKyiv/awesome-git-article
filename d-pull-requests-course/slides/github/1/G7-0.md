You can squash commits when merging a pull request to gain a more streamlined view of changes.



Commit squashing has the benefit of keeping your git history tidy and easier to digest than the alternative created by merge commits.


While merge commits retain commits like **“oops missed a spot”** and **“maybe fix that test? [round 2]”**, squashing retains the changes but omits the individual commits from history.

Many people prefer this workflow because, while those work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, they aren’t necessarily important to retain when looking at the history of your base branch.
