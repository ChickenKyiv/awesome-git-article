Requesting a pull request review
After you create a pull request, you can ask a specific person to review the changes you've proposed.
If you're an organization member, you can also request a specific team to review your changes.

Repository owners and collaborators can request a pull request review from anyone with read access to the repository.
Organization members can also request a pull request review from teams with read access to the repository.
The requested reviewer or team will receive a notification that you asked them to review the pull request.

**Note: Pull request authors can't request reviews unless they are either a repository owner or collaborator with write access to the repository.**

You can request a review from either a suggested or specific person.
Suggested reviewers are based on git blame data.
If you request a review, other people with read access to the repository can still review your pull request.
Once someone has reviewed your pull request and you've made the necessary changes, you can re-request review from the same reviewer.
If the requested reviewer does not submit a review, and the pull request meets the repository's mergeability requirements, you can still merge the pull request.

Under your repository name, click  Pull requests.

Issues and pull requests tab selection

In the list of pull requests, click the pull request that you'd like to ask a specific person or a team to review.

Navigate to Reviewers in the right sidebar.

Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request

#### About reviewing pull requests

You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time.
While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes.
After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed.
This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review.
A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed.
After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or request additional changes by submitting your review with a summary comment.

**Tip: You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for review with the search qualifier review-requested:[USERNAME] or team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME].
For more information, see "Searching issues and pull requests."**

Click Submit review.

Tips:

If required reviews are enabled and a collaborator with write, admin, or owner access to the repository submits a review requesting changes, the pull request cannot be merged until the same collaborator submits another review approving the changes in the pull request.


Repository owners and administrators can merge a pull request even if it hasn't received an approving review, or if a reviewer who requested changes has left the organization or is unavailable.


If both required reviews and stale review dismissal are enabled and a code-modifying commit is pushed to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval is dismissed.
The pull request must be reviewed and approved again before it can be merged.


When several open pull requests each have a head branch pointing to the same commit, you wonâ€™t be able to merge them if one or both have a pending or rejected review.
