By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch.

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists.

You can also swap your `HEAD` and `base` branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points.

References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.
