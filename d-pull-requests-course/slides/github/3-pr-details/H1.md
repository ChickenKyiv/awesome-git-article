Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository.


These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the `master` branch only contains finished and approved work.




Anyone with read permissions to a repository can create a pull request, but you must have write permissions to create a branch.

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and don't have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first.
