Into explanation of how git works something in the middle or after working first things like commit, status, etc.

#### HEAD
**HEAD** is a reference to the last commit in the currently check-out branch. You can think of the **HEAD** as the "current branch". When you switch branches with git checkout, the **HEAD** revision changes to point to the tip of the new branch.

#### Close Git issue from commit

The following keywords, followed by an issue number, will close the issue:

`close`
`closes`
`closed`
`fix`
`fixes`
`fixed`
`resolve`
`resolves`
`resolved`
For example, to close an issue numbered 123,
you could use the phrase "Closes #123" or "Closes: #123" in your pull request description or commit message. Once the branch is merged into the default branch, the issue will close.

#### origin

#### branch -a

#### fetch

#### pull

#### merge

#### stash

#### cherry pick
