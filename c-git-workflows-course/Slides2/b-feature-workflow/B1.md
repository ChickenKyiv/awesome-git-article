#### Git Feature Branch Workflow

The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch.

This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase.

It also means the master branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.
