#### Create a new-branch

Use a separate branch for each feature or issue you work on.
 After creating a branch, check it out locally so that any changes you make will be on that branch.

`git checkout -b new-feature`

This checks out a branch called new-feature based on master, and the **-b** flag tells Git to create the branch if it doesnâ€™t already exist.



#### Update, add, commit, and push changes

On this branch, edit, stage, and commit changes in the usual fashion, building up the feature with as many commits as necessary.

Work on the feature and make commits like you would any time you use Git.

When ready, push your commits, updating the feature branch on GitHub.

```
git status
git add <some-file>
git commit
```
