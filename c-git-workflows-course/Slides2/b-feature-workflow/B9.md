#### Resolve feedback

Now teammates comment and approve the pushed commits.

Resolve their comments locally, commit, and push the suggested changes to GitHub.

Your updates appear in the pull request.



#### Merge your pull request

Before you merge, you may have to resolve merge conflicts if others have made changes to the repo.

When your pull request is approved and conflict-free, you can add your code to the master branch.

Merge from the pull request in GitHub Pull Requests tab at your repository.




#### Pull requests

Aside from isolating feature development, branches make it possible to discuss changes via pull requests.

Once someone completes a feature, they donâ€™t immediately merge it into master.

Instead, they push the feature branch to the central server and file a pull request asking to merge their additions into master.

This gives other developers an opportunity to review the changes before they become a part of the main codebase.
