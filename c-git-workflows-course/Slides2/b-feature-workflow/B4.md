The Feature Branch Workflow assumes a central repository, and master represents the official project history.

Instead of committing directly on their local master branch, developers create a new branch every time they start work on a new feature.

Feature branches should have descriptive names, like **animated-menu-items** or **issue-#1061**.

The idea is to give a clear, highly-focused purpose to each branch.

Git makes no technical distinction between the master branch and feature branches, so developers can edit, stage, and commit changes to a feature branch.
