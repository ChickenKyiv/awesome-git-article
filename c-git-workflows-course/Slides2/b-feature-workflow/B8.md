Itâ€™s a good idea to push the feature branch up to the central repository.

This serves as a convenient backup, when collaborating with other developers, this would give them access to view commits to the new branch.

`git push -u origin new-feature`

This command pushes new-feature to the central repository (origin), and the **-u** flag adds it as a remote tracking branch.

After setting up the tracking branch, `git push` can be invoked without any parameters to automatically push the new-feature branch to the central repository.

To get feedback on the new feature branch, create a pull request in a repository management solution like GitHub repositories.

From there, you can add reviewers and make sure everything is good to go before merging.
