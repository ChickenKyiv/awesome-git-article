#### Start with the master branch

All feature branches are created off the latest code state of a project.

This guide assumes this is maintained and updated in the master branch.

```
git checkout master
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

This switches the repo to the master branch, pulls the latest commits and resets the repo's local copy of master to match the latest version.

Then you creating a new branch for working on separated issue/feature.
