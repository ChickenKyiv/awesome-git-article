Using a dedicated branch to prepare releases makes it possible for one team to polish the current release while another team continues working on features for the next release.
It also creates well-defined phases of development (e.g., it's easy to say, “This week we're preparing for version 4.0,” and to actually see it in the structure of the repository).




Making release branches is another straightforward branching operation.
Like feature branches, release branches are based on the develop branch.
A new release branch can be created using the following methods.

Without the git-flow extensions:

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/0.1.0
```

When using the git-flow extensions:
```
$ git flow release start 0.1.0
```


Switched to a new branch 'release/0.1.0'

Once the release is ready to ship, it will get merged it into master and develop, then the release branch will be deleted.
It’s important to merge back into develop because critical updates may have been added to the release branch and they need to be accessible to new features.
If your organization stresses code review, this would be an ideal place for a pull request.



To finish a release branch, use the following methods:

Without the git-flow extensions:

```
git checkout master
git merge release/0.1.0
```

Or with the git-flow extension:

git flow release finish '0.1.0'
