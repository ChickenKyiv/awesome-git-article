#### Finishing a feature branch
When you’re done with the development work on the feature, the next step is to merge the `feature_branch` into `develop`.


Without the git-flow extensions:
```
git checkout develop
git merge feature_branch
```
Using the git-flow extensions:

```
git flow feature finish feature_branch
```
