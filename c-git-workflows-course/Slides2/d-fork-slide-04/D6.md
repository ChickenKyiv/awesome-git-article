To integrate the feature into the official codebase, the maintainer pulls the contributor’s changes into their local repository, checks to make sure it doesn’t break the project, merges it into their local master branch, then pushes the master branch to the official repository on the server.
The contribution is now part of the project, and other developers should pull from the official repository to synchronize their local repositories.


It’s important to understand that the notion of an “official” repository in the Forking Workflow is merely a convention.
In fact, the only thing that makes the official repository so official is that it’s the public repository of the project maintainer.
