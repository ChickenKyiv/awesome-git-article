#### Fork a repository
git fork workflow - fork a repositiory
All new developers to a Forking Workflow project need to fork the official repository.
As previously stated, forking is just a standard git clone operation.
It’s possible to do this by SSH’ing into the server and running `git clone` to copy it to another location on the server.
Popular Git hosting services like GitHub, offer repo forking features that automate this step.
