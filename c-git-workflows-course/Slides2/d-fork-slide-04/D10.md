#### Clone your fork
Next each developer needs to clone their own public forked repository.
They can do this with the familiar `git clone` command.

Assuming the use of GitHub to host these repositories, developers on a project should have their own GitHub account and they should clone their forked copy of the repository with:

`git clone https://user@host/user/repo.git`
