#### Forking vs cloning
It's important to note that "forked" repositories and "forking" are not special operations.
Forked repositories are created using the standard git clone command.
Forked repositories are generally "server-side clones" and usually managed and hosted by a 3rd party Git service like GitHub.

There is no unique Git command to create forked repositories.
A clone operation is essentially a copy of a repository and its history.
