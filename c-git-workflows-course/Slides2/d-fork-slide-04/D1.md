Forking Workflow Intro


The Forking Workflow is fundamentally different than other popular Git workflows.
Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, it gives every developer their own server-side repository.
This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one.
The Forking Workflow is most often seen in public open source projects.
