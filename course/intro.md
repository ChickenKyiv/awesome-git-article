#### Course Description
This course is for beginners software engineers. It will teach you the basics about coding workflow, that millions of developers using worldwide. Each day. It can be a good foundation that can help you to create a good software in future.
You will learn about the history of code version system, how to use it, how to collaborate with other developers and how to prevent errors or intersections. and at the same time, developing code projects.
Hope you will enjoy it and in a few years you become a coding rock-star. Good luck!

If you are a developer and you want to get started with Git and GitHub, then this course is made for you.

After a short introduction on what is Git and how to use it, you will be able to create and work on a GitHub project.
## What is Git?
Git is a free and open source software created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.  This tool is a version control system that was  initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.
> As of 2018, almost 90% of the 74,000 developers surveyed by Stack Overflow prefer to use Git for version control. Git dominates all other version control systems and adoption is up almost 20% from 2017 according to the survey. However, Git has not always been this ubiquitous. Let’s take a look at its ascent into mass popularity.

In its simplest term it’s like a “Save As”. You want the new file without getting rid of the changes on the old one. It’s an everyday situation, except on a software project there is the potential for a lot of changes.

Repository/repo: The database storing the files.
Branch: Create a separate copy of a repo for use on your computer.
Revert/rollback: Go back to a previously saved version of the codebase/repo.
Push: Push is an access level on the repo, if you have no push access you will need to make a pull request.
Pull: If you have no Push access you can make a pull request which will notify the repo owner you want to merge your changes into their code.
