However, using Git to power your development workflow presents a few advantages over SVN.

**First, it gives every developer their own local copy of the entire project.**

This isolated environment lets each developer work independently of all other changes to a project - they can add commits to their local repository and completely forget about upstream developments until it's convenient for them.

**Second, it gives you access to Gitâ€™s robust branching and merging model.**

Unlike SVN, Git branches are designed to be a fail-safe mechanism for integrating code and sharing changes between repositories.

The Centralized Workflow is similar to other workflows in its utilization of a remote server-side hosted repository that developers push and pull form.

Compared to other workflows, the Centralized Workflow has no defined pull request or forking patterns.

A Centralized Workflow is generally better suited for teams migrating from SVN to Git and smaller size teams.
