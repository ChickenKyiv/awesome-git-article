- Centralized Workflow
git workflow | Central and local repositories

The Centralized Workflow is a great Git workflow for teams transitioning from SVN.

Like Subversion, the Centralized Workflow uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project.

Instead of trunk, the default development branch is called master and all changes are committed into this branch.

This workflow doesn’t require any other branches besides master.

Transitioning to a distributed version control system may seem like a daunting task, but you don’t have to change your existing workflow to take advantage of Git.

Your team can develop projects in the exact same way as they do with Subversion.
