#### Where to go from here

As you can see, it’s possible to replicate a traditional Subversion development environment using only a handful of Git commands.

The Centralized Workflow is great for small teams.

The conflict resolution process detailed above can form a bottleneck as your team scales in size.

If your team is comfortable with the Centralized Workflow but wants to streamline its collaboration efforts, it's definitely worth exploring the benefits of the Feature Branch Workflow.

By dedicating an isolated branch to each feature, it’s possible to initiate in-depth discussions around new additions before integrating them into the official project.
