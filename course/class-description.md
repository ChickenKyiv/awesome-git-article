Example:
This class is about learning how flexboxes work.
Did you hear about them before?

It's a module, that has roots at Mozilla. It's a big timesaver for Frontend developers.
You'll never want to create an HTML page without flexboxes after this course.

We'll learn only basic things. Specification mostly.

All CSS properties related to flexboxes.
And we'll have a set of easy practical lessons.
For each practice lesson, I advise you to recreate an example from scratch(no copy-paste) by your hands.


Be aware, that this course touching only flexbox basics, so you need to know HTML and CSS.
