Please read this article - [Trunk based development vs git-flow](https://codeburst.io/trunk-based-development-vs-git-flow-a0212a6cae64)
 if you want to pass an examp quiestions related to git basics. I'll examine you.
You need to understand the logic of future branching.


#### Practice part(aka exam).
- [ ] please delete everything from master branch. only readme file should be.
- [ ] create a featured branch from master and call it `develop`.
- [ ] put all your current code on this branch and commit it by using CLI(before you just drag-n-drop your code in browser)
- [ ] push changes into the repository so i can see your actual progress
- [ ] create a featured branch from `develop` and name it understandable. at this branch, you'll install packages flow-bin and jest
- [ ] create featured brach from `develop` and name it too. at this branch, you'll work on next code chapter, so name should show this.
- [ ] push this updates to code repo and buzz me.

later
- [ ] let's create some merge conflicts(i'll try to help you) - buzz me when you'll get to this stage.
- [ ] creating 2 independent branches from `master` - make changes at `branch01`, open a pull request. checkout from `master` another branch - `branch001`. checkout pull request from `branch01` and try to add your code changes from `branch001`








generate a merge conflict
1 branch

paste
```
1
- 11
- 12
- 13
 - 131
 - 132
- 14

2
- 21
- 22
- 23
- 24
- 25
```

paste
```
100
-101
-102
- 103
- 104
- 105
- 106
```

same file for generating an issue
first version to solve this

rename a file at one of your brances - make a commit and issue will gone

or copy your code, and place it after your changes from other branch

it's maybe not the best way to solve coding conflicts, but it will give you an idea about how git tracking changes inside files

Вместо кода, я буду использовать текст из моего курса.
чтобы кодом одного определенного языка не сбивать людей, которые не знают синтаксис этого языка.....


1) branch
Unit 1/
 chapter1.md
 chapter2.md


 2) branch
 Unit 2 /
   chapter1.md

unit 3
/ chapter1.md

unit 4
/ chapter 1   

надо показать разные методы работы git-flow чтобы можно было touch a different aspects of coding workflow.
+ showing forking will be an awesome
