Please read this article if you want to pass an examp quiestions related to git basics. I'll examine you.
You need to understand the logic of future branching.


#### Practice part(aka exam).
- [ ] please delete everything from master branch. only readme file should be.
- [ ] create a featured branch from master and call it `develop`.
- [ ] put all your current code on this branch and commit it by using CLI(before you just drag-n-drop your code in browser)
- [ ] push changes into the repository so i can see your actual progress
- [ ] create a featured branch from `develop` and name it understandable. at this branch, you'll install packages flow-bin and jest
- [ ] create featured brach from `develop` and name it too. at this branch, you'll work on next code chapter, so name should show this.
- [ ] push this updates to code repo and buzz me.

later
- [ ] let's create some merge conflicts(i'll try to help you) - buzz me when you'll get to this stage.
- [ ] creating 2 independent branches from `master` - make changes at `branch01`, open a pull request. checkout from `master` another branch - `branch001`. checkout pull request from `branch01` and try to add your code changes from `branch001`
