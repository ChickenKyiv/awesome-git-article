#### You cannot know basics of git without:

- [ ] convert flow to good git-flow.
- [ ] broke few forks(0)
- [ ] make 30 commits (0)
- [ ] make 9 pull requests (0)
- [ ] make 6 merge conflicts and fix them (0)
- [ ] make 5-10 future branches, related in a different ways(few times checkout from develop, few times from each other feature branch)(0)
- [ ] 6 branch merges(0)

Note: **you should use command line only, no GUI**

#### Practice part(aka exam). 
- [ ] please delete everything from master branch. only readme file should be.
- [ ] create a featured branch from master and call it `develop`.
- [ ] put all your current code on this branch and commit it by using CLI(before you just drag-n-drop your code in browser)
- [ ] push changes into the repository so i can see your actual progress
- [ ] create a featured branch from `develop` and name it understandable. at this branch, you'll install packages flow-bin and jest
- [ ] create featured brach from `develop` and name it too. at this branch, you'll work on next code chapter, so name should show this. 
- [ ] push this updates to code repo and buzz me.

later
- [ ] let's create some merge conflicts(i'll try to help you) - buzz me when you'll get to this stage.


#### Questions
- Tell me please what is `HEAD` thing about?
- Do you know how to close GitHub issue from git commit?
- what is `origin`?
- how to list all branches inside the repo?
- what difference between `fetch` and `pull`
- `stash` tell me more about it
