Wow! Looks like you completed this course.
I'm glad you make it to the end.
I hope you'll start to use pull requests soon and start to feel how powerful a tool it is.


This was the first part of the "Pull Requests In-Depth" course
I'll advise you to start a second part - because it will give you more detailed information about how pull requests can be used in the modern software development workflow.
