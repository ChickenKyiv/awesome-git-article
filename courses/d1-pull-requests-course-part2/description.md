Free and open-source, Git is a distributed version control system that makes collaborative software projects more manageable. Many projects maintain their files in a Git repository, and sites like GitHub have made sharing and contributing to code simple, valuable, and effective.

Open-source projects that are hosted in public repositories benefit from contributions made by the broader developer community through pull requests, which request that a project accept changes you have made to its code repository.

This course will guide you through making a pull request to a Git repository at GitHub. It will help to understand how you can contribute to open-source software projects and private as well.

We will also discuss a lot of details, related to pull requests, workflows, common tasks that can be done.
We have a lot of "how-to" lessons, so you can try how things work by your hands.
