Even if you can use conflict editor on GitHub i'll advice you to use IDE + command line for conflict management.

Because it will give you more power. For sure, for small quick changes this tool can be useful.

Especially if you lazy like me and want to have a quick turnaround. But it better to understand a common way to solving merge conflicts.

Especially when we have so many great tools that is fine tailored for developers.


I'm using Atom editor right now, because it was made by GitHub team and have nice features to work especially with GitHub.

You even can review pull requests and view/post comments at conversation space inside at pull requests space.
