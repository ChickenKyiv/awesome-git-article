title: What is a Pull Request Template?
sidebar_label: x
---


When you initiate a new pull request for an implemented feature or a bug fix in your project repository,

you can allow the description field to pre-populate with  a checklist of items relevant to your team,

like the checklist provided in the previous section.

This process of exhibiting the pre-filled description field in pull request

form is often referred to as a `Pull Request` or `Merge Request Template`.


For an automatic pre-population of details in the description field,

you must first define your own set of templates and then add them to the projectâ€™s root directory.

You can also create multiple templates separately for bugs, features, documentation, etc..
