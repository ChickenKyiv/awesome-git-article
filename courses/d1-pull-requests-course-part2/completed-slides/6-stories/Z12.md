I hope you enjoy this stories so much as I did!

I think it's always important to understand how people manage your work, so you can do it better.

A lot of their comments seems so obvious, but sometimes it's hard to imagine how you actually can use a new tool, right?

I think there a lot of information about reviewing process for you to digest.

And maybe from the begining you'll not be able to use everything, but when time will come - you'll remember this stories and be able to improve your processes.

It will help you to get more quick updates, related to your code changes and also become a better `code citizen` so everyone at team will have a better workflow.


after this section I think you have an answer to
**What's your typical process for reviewing a pull request in GitHub?** question.
