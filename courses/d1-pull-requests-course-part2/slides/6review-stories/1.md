What's your typical process for reviewing a pull request in GitHub?

When I was preparing details, related to pull request reviews I find a great forum thread.

Where a lot of git repository maintainers sharing their reasons
of why and how they using pull requests at their work.

So I decide to copy-paste here most interesting comments here and share with my students.

Most of content is quotes from their comments, but I'll highlight some information and tell you my opinion about it.
