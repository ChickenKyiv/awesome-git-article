<!-- ####  -->

If your project repository is on GitHub, the name of the template and where it’s located in your repository matters a lot.

The template created as a Markdown file should be named `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` by default and placed in either the project’s root folder or `.github` directory.

Create a Markdown file, name it `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and place it in the project’s root folder.

Or, create a directory, name it `.github`, and place the Markdown file in this folder.

**NOTE: Make sure to place the Markdown file within one of the previously mentioned locations and save and merge it with the same name.**

Now, when you create a new pull request, you will see the template content automatically loaded into the description field as shown in the following image.
