If you do have multiple template files in GitHub, you will always need to manually navigate to the URL of the specific Markdown file you want to pre-populate in the pull request form.




For example, I’m creating a Markdown file and naming it `bug-template.md`.

I place it in the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` folder of my main repository.

When I want to push some changes into this main repository, I will initiate a new pull request.

To pre-populate my pull request form with the content of the `bug-template.md` file, I need to navigate to the URL by passing an additional template parameter:


https://github.com/REPOSITORY_NAME/compare/master…Test_branch?expand=1&**template=bug-template.md**

Here, **Scheduler-Project** refers to the name of my main repository and I’m trying to merge the code changes from the **Test_branch** into my **master** branch. At the end of the URL, there’s **template=bug-template.md** to pre-populate the content of the **bug-template.md** file into my pull request form.

Now, after making these URL changes, you can see the description content being loaded in the pull request form as follows.

You can edit the previous description with relevant details and click the `Create pull request` button, which will open your submitted pull request page as follows.
