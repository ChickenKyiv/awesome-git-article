As developers, our responsibility is not only to fix issues or implement new features,
but to clearly communicate the development work to reviewers. A developer can convey proposed code changes and their purposes either through detailed documentation or other means of communication.

Hereâ€™s where the inevitable descriptions of pull or merge requests come into play,
where the code contributors share detailed comments on their code.





#### What Role Does a Description Play in a Pull Request?

Providing descriptions for pull requests is highly recommended for a better code review process. Descriptions clearly answer:

What can reviewers expect while reviewing the submitted code?
What standards has the developer considered before submitting their code for review?
Later, the reviewers can initiate an open discussion between themselves and the developers to track every code change before those changes are pushed into repositories.
