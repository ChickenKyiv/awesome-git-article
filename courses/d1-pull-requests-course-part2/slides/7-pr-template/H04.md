title: What Role Does a Description Play in a Pull Request?
sidebar_label: x

Providing descriptions for pull requests is highly recommended for a better code review process.
 Descriptions clearly answer:

- What can reviewers expect while reviewing the submitted code?

- What standards has the developer considered before submitting their code for review?

Later, the reviewers can initiate an open discussion between themselves and the developers to track every code change before those changes are pushed into repositories.
