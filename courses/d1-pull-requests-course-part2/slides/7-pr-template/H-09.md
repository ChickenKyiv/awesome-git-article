To make use of different templates, you must first create multiple template files and save them as separate Markdown files in your repository, as explained in the following steps:




#### How to create multiple pull request templates

1. Create a folder named `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` and place it within either the root directory or the directory named `.github`.

2. Create multiple template Markdown files and place them all in the folder `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`.


To create multiple pull request templates and use the template query parameter to specify a `template` to fill the pull request body, type `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`, then the name of your pull request template.

For example, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template_basic.md`.

You can also store multiple pull request templates in a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` subdirectory within the `root` or `docs/` directories


**NOTE: The Markdown files created in this process can be named as you choose, but the folder mentioned in the first step must have the name PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.**

3. In the body of the new file, add your pull request template. This could include:

- A reference to a `related issue` in your repository. (Example: Issue can be connected with similar keyword `#123`)
- A description of the changes proposed in the pull request.
- `@mentions` of the person or team responsible for reviewing proposed changes.

4. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.

You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message.

5. Push changes to main repository or push to forked repo and then open a pull request.


**Note: Templates are available to collaborators when they are merged into the repository's default branch.**
