#### How to Create Multiple Pull Request Templates in GitHub

It wouldnâ€™t be sensible to use the same description template for different categories of pull requests.

For example, you may need to initiate a pull request for submitting the code changes of a newly implemented feature, a simple bug fix, documentation, or any kind of configuration work.

It would be best for each of these pull request links to load and pre-populate different template contents in the description fields based on the submitted pull request category.

To make use of different templates, you must first create multiple template files and save them as separate Markdown files in your repository, as explained in the following steps:

1. Create a folder named `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` and place it within either the root directory or the directory named `.github`.

2. Create multiple template Markdown files and place them all in the folder `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`.

**NOTE: The Markdown files created in this process can be named as you choose, but the folder mentioned in the first step must have the name PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.**
