<!-- ## resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line -->

- For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the merge conflict in a local clone of the repository and push the change to your branch on GitHub. You can use the command line or a tool like GitHub Desktop to push the change.

If you have a merge conflict on the command line, you cannot push your local changes to GitHub until you resolve the merge conflict locally on your computer.

If you try merging branches on the command line that have a merge conflict, you'll get an error message.

Simple workflow that will show you problems with automatical merge

```sh
$ git merge BRANCH-NAME
> Auto-merging styleguide.md
> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in styleguide.md
> Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result
```
