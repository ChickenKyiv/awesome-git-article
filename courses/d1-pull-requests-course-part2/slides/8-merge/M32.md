UPDATE!!!




I think information from this course will help you in future to understand better how to collaborate with your team members.

Communication is a biggest problem in software development teams.

I think that skills is not so important.
You can be very skilled developer, but if you cannot effectively work with your team mates - then you'll struggle, even if you have a lot of experience.

Pull requests is a great separated space, that will give you a lot of features, that focused on productivity and will help you to create a better software.

Again, this is a first part of a course. It's a set of theoretical information that should help you to understand how pull requests works under the hood.

For more advanced explanation related to all features that you can use at your pull requests - jump into the second part of this course that you can find at my profile.

Thank you for your time and hope you'll use this knowledge for better!

Good luck.
