**You can resolve simple merge conflicts that involve competing line changes on GitHub, using the conflict editor.**

You can only resolve merge conflicts on GitHub that are caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository.

For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the conflict locally on the command line.


**Warning: When you resolve a merge conflict on GitHub, the entire base branch of your pull request is merged into the head branch, even if the head branch is the default branch of your repository, like master, or a protected branch.**

**Make sure you really want to commit to this branch.**
