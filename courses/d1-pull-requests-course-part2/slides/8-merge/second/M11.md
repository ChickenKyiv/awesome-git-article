To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the conflicted file to select the changes that you want to keep in the final merge.

There are a couple of different ways to resolve a merge conflict:

1. **Github conflict editor**

2. **Resolving a merge conflict on the command line.**




If your merge conflict is caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository, you can resolve it on GitHub using the conflict editor.



We'll have more detailed how-to workflow of how to use conflict editor in next slides
