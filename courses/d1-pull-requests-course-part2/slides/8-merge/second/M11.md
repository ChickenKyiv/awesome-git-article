To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the conflicted file to select the changes that you want to keep in the final merge.

There are a couple of different ways to resolve a merge conflict:

1. **Github conflict editor**

2. **Resolving a merge conflict on the command line.**

#### Github conflict editor


If your merge conflict is caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository, you can resolve it on GitHub using the conflict editor.



We'll have more detailed how-to workflow of how to use conflict editor in next slides

At next slide we'll talk about other ways to resolving conflicts

## Resolving a merge conflict on GitHub

#### You can resolve simple merge conflicts that involve competing line changes on GitHub, using the conflict editor.

You can only resolve merge conflicts on GitHub that are caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository.

For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the conflict locally on the command line.

**Warning: When you resolve a merge conflict on GitHub, the entire base branch of your pull request is merged into the head branch, even if the head branch is the default branch of your repository, like master, or a protected branch. Make sure you really want to commit to this branch.**

#### How to use conflict editor

1. Under your repository name, click `Pull requests`.
2. In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve.

3. Near the bottom of your pull request, click `Resolve conflicts`.

**Tip: If the Resolve conflicts button is deactivated, your pull request's merge conflict is too complex to resolve on GitHub.**
**You must resolve the merge conflict using another Git client like Atom's Git integration or the command line.**
