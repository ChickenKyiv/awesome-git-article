You aren't able to automatically rebase and merge on GitHub when:
- The pull request has merge conflicts.

- Rebasing the commits from the base branch into the head branch runs into conflicts.

- Rebasing the commits is considered "unsafe," such as when a rebase is possible without merge conflicts but would produce a different result than a merge would.

If you still want to rebase the commits but can't rebase and merge automatically on GitHub you must:

- Rebase the topic branch (or head branch) onto the base branch locally on the command line

- Resolve any merge conflicts on the command line.

- Force-push the rebased commits to the pull request's topic branch (or remote head branch).

Anyone with write permissions in the repository, can then `merge the changes` using the rebase and merge button on GitHub.
