The remote `refs/pull/` namespace is `read-only`. If you try to push any commits there, you'll see this error:

```sh
! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/pull/1/head (deny updating a hidden ref)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.local:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git'
```


**Tip: When you remove or rename a remote reference, your local `refs/pull/origin/` namespace will not be affected by calls to `git-remote`.**
