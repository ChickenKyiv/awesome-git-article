#### You can customize access to each repository in your organization with granular permission levels, giving people access to the features and tasks they need.

People with admin permissions can manage individual and team access to an organization-owned repository.



You can give organization members, outside collaborators, and teams of people different levels of access to repositories owned by an organization.

Each permission level progressively increases access to a repository's content and settings.

From least access to most access, the permission levels for an organization repository are:

**Read**: Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project

**Triage (beta)**: Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access

**Write**: Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project

**Maintain (beta)**: Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions

**Admin**: Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository

**Note: The triage and maintain roles are currently in public beta and are subject to change. The new roles will be gradually rolled out to all organizations soon.**
