It previous lesson we have one line that I want to explore here in more details

**Fetch the reference to the pull request based on its ID number, creating a new branch in the process.**

`$ git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME`



Let me break that command down a bit:

1. The `origin` in this case refers to the Git remote
for this repository on GitHub.

If you are using the
**fork-and-pull method of collaborating**
via Git and GitHub,
then you will have multiple Git remotes—and
the remote you want probably isn’t `origin`.

For example, if you want to fetch a pull request
 from the original (not forked) repository,
 you’d want to use the name that corresponds
 to the Git remote for the original repository
 (I use `upstream` in these cases).

The `pull/1234/head` portion refers to the pull request
 on GitHub.

Every pull request has a number assigned.
If the pull request is #10, then the path would be `pull/10/head`.

If the pull request is `#9182`, then the path is `pull/9182/head`.

3. The `:pr-1234` portion of the command points to the
local branch into which you’d like the specified pull request
 to be fetched.

 4. **This branch should not already exist.**
 If you try to fetch into an existing branch,
 the command will fail, so specify the name of a
 branch you’d like created as part of the process.

---

Once you run the command and the fetch is successful,
then you can switch to the branch with
`git checkout pr-1234` (or whatever name you gave the new branch)
and start reviewing the contents of the pull request.

Very handy!
