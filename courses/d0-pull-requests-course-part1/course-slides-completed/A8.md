There is only one public repository in the Feature Branch Workflow, so the pull requestâ€™s destination repository and the source repository will always be the same.

Typically, the developer will specify their feature branch as the source branch and the master branch as the destination branch.


- After receiving the pull request, the project maintainer has to decide what to do.

- If the feature is ready to go, they can simply merge it into master and close the pull request.

- But, if there are problems with the proposed changes, they can post feedback in the pull request.

- Follow-up commits will show up right next to the relevant comments.
