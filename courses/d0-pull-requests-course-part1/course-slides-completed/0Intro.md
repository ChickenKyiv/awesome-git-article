Welcome to course, where you'll learn about awesome collaboration concept for software developers.

When I prepare most slides, related to pull requests - I find out that this course is huge and I have a lot of information that I want to share with my students.

So I decide to split it into 2 parts.
This course is a first part.
I'll talk about theory and basic terms, related to pull requests.


You will learn the structure of pull request and why to use them.

How pull requests works inside at GitHub.

How pull requests works with different git workflows such as forking workflow, feature branch workflow and gitflow.

Then I'll show you a default case, where few people collaborating together with same codebase in the same time.
