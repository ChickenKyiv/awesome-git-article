I'm very glad that you decide to join my course.
Knowledge of pull requests is essential for any software engineer, in my opinion. Communication and collaboration skills are undervalued at modern tech society.

I think you cannot create great software on your own.
When you working as a team member, collaboration is a very crucial part of the process. When you can showcase what you're doing and communicate with other people while you showing your code - you can accomplish more. And spend less time.

Hope you will enjoy this course! Good luck.

Again, this is a first part of the "Pull Requests In-Depth" course, so it better to attend a second part(which contains more lessons inside) after finishing this course.
