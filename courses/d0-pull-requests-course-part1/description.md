Welcome to course, where you'll learn about Pull Requests - an awesome collaboration concept for software developers.

I'll talk about theory and basic terms, related to pull requests.

You will learn the structure of the pull request and why to use them.

How pull requests work inside at GitHub.

How pull requests work with different git workflows such as forking workflow, feature branch workflow and gitflow.

Then I'll show you a default case, where few people collaborating together with the same codebase at the same time.

------------

A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project or private projects hosted on server-side service for hosting repositories, like GitHub. It is often the preferred way of submitting contributions to a project using a distributed version control system (DVCS) such as Git. A pull request occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repository to be considered for inclusion in a project’s main repository.

It is important to note that “pull requests” are a workflow method, and are not a feature of the version control system itself. This course will provide a simple overview of pull requests and how they are created, using the Git version control system and GitHub hosting site as examples.



----------

Free and open-source, Git is a distributed version control system that makes collaborative software projects more manageable. Many projects maintain their files in a Git repository, and sites like GitHub have made sharing and contributing to code simple, valuable, and effective.

Open-source projects that are hosted in public repositories benefit from contributions made by the broader developer community through pull requests, which request that a project accept changes you have made to its code repository.

This course will guide you through making a pull request to a Git repository at GitHub. It will help to understand how you can contribute to open-source software projects and private as well.

We will also discuss a lot of details, related to pull requests, workflows, common tasks that can be done.
We have a lot of "how-to" lessons, so you can try how things work by your hands.
