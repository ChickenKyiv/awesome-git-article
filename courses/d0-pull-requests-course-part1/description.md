Welcome to course, where you'll learn about Pull Requests - an awesome collaboration concept for software developers.

A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project or private projects hosted on server-side service for hosting repositories, like GitHub.

It is often the preferred way of submitting contributions to a project using a distributed version control system such as Git. A pull request occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repository to be considered for inclusion in a project’s main repository.

It is important to note that “pull requests” are a workflow method, and are not a feature of the version control system itself.

This course will provide a simple overview of pull requests and how they are created, using the Git version control system and GitHub hosting site as examples.

I'll talk about theory and basic terms, related to pull requests.

You will learn the structure of the pull request and why to use them.

How pull requests work inside at GitHub.

How pull requests work with different git workflows such as forking workflow, feature branch workflow and gitflow.

Then I'll show you a default case, where few people collaborating together with the same codebase at the same time.
