Welcome to the ZIZO design and product ideation course. This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs, startups founders and product managers to learn a new and proven way to build product ideas from scratch and improve existing product features by zooming in and zooming out the different design layers. The course teaches how to use the three design layers (Flow, Interface and Action) and build your startup product ideas from both high level and strategic perspective and the most detailed level of user action design.

I am working with startups in diverse fields from AI to medical devices, and guide their teams to ideate iterate and zoom in and zoom out constantly to align the team and optimize their products. I have been working with startups from top programs such as Singularity University, WeWork Labs and Zinc.VCs.

This course was created because of the feedback and great demand I saw in startup founders after consultation sessions and workshops. Now it's available for everyone!
