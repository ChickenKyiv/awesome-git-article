#### How to update an inactive PR

1. Under your repository name, click  `Issues` or  `Pull requests`.

repo-settings-issues-pull-requests
![xxx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-git-article/master/img/PR/repo-tabs-pull-requests.png)

2. In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request you'd like to merge.

3. Find the ID number of the inactive pull request. This is the sequence of digits right after the pull request's title.

pull_request_id_number (1)
![xxx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-git-article/master/img/PR/repo-tabs-pull-requests.png)

4. Open the terminal.

5. Fetch the reference to the pull request based on its ID number, creating a new branch in the process.

`$ git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME`

6. Switch to the new branch that's based on this pull request:

```sh
[master] $ git checkout BRANCHNAME
> Switched to a new branch 'BRANCHNAME'
```

7. At this point, you can do anything you want with this branch. You can run some local tests, or merge other branches into it, including `master`. Make modifications as you see fit!

8. When you're ready, you can push the new branch up:

```sh
[pull-inactive-pull-request] $ git push origin BRANCHNAME

> Total 29 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0)
> To https://github.com/username/repository.git
>  * [new branch]      BRANCHNAME -> BRANCHNAME

```


9. Create a new pull request with your new branch.
