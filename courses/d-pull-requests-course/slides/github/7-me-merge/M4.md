## Rebase and merge your pull request commits

When you select the `Rebase and merge` option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the topic branch (or head branch) are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit. Pull requests with rebased commits are merged using the `fast-forward` option.

To rebase and merge pull requests, you must have **write permissions** in the repository, and the repository must **allow rebase merging**.

The rebase and merge behavior on GitHub deviates slightly from `git rebase`.
Rebase and merge on GitHub will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs, whereas `git rebase` outside of GitHub does not change the committer information when the rebase happens on top of an ancestor commit.

For more information about `git rebase`, see the "Git rebase" chapter from the Pro Git book.
