You must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge a pull request on GitHub.

If you have a merge conflict between the compare branch and base branch in your pull request, you can view a list of the files with conflicting changes above the `Merge pull request` button.

The `Merge pull request` button is deactivated until you've resolved all conflicts between the compare branch and base branch.
