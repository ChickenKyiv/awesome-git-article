#### Description Checklist


To make a pull request as clear as possible, it should include an appropriate checklist of relevant information about the proposed code changes (instead of a single line summary), such as:

How a bug was fixed and a description for the  solution.
A description or summary of a new feature.
The unit test cases covered.

Whether this code breaks existing functionalities.
Any testing details.

Whether it was tested in all devices and browsers.

Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if these checklists showed up automatically in the description field every time you made a new pull request?


Good news! The Gitflow model offers this ability through the template option.



You can see an example of how these descriptions are viewed in a pull request in the following image.
