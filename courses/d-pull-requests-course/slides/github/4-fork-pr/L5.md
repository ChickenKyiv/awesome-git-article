Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork

**For greater collaboration, you can allow commits on branches you've created from forks.

Permission to commit to your forked branches is limited to those with push access to the upstream repository of the fork.**

Only pull request creators can give upstream repository maintainers, or those with push access to the upstream repository, permission to make commits to their pull request's compare branch.

Pull request creators can give these permissions on each of their pull requests when they initially create a pull request from a fork or after they have created the pull request.

You can set commit permissions when you first create a pull request from a fork.

Additionally, you can modify an existing pull request to let repository maintainers make commits to your branch.
