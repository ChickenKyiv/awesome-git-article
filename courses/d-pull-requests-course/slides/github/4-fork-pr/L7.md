**You can commit changes on a pull request branch that was created from a fork of your repository with permission from the pull request creator.**

You can only make commits on pull request branches that:

- are opened in a repository that you have push access to and that were created from a fork of that repository
- have permission granted from the pull request creator
- don't have branch restrictions that will prevent you from committing

Only the user who created the pull request can give you permission to push commits to their branch.

**Note: You can also make commits to a pull request branch from a fork of your repository through GitHub by creating your own copy (or fork) of the fork of your repository and committing changes to the same head branch that the original pull request changes were created on.**
