If you've forked a repository and made changes to the fork, you can ask that the upstream repository accept your changes by creating a pull request.

You can open a pull request to the upstream repository from any branch or commit in your fork.

We recommend that you make changes in a topic branch, so that you can push `follow up commits` if
you receive feedback on your pull request.

You also have the option to give the upstream repository's maintainers the
ability to make commits on your topic branch to update your pull request.
