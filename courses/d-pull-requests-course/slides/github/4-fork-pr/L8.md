1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the fork (or copy of your repository) where the pull request branch was created.

---


2. Under the fork's repository name, click `Clone or download`.

---


3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click copy URL button to copy the clone URL for the repository.

---


4. Open the terminal.

**Tip: If you prefer to clone the fork using GitHub Desktop**

---


5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to download the cloned directory.

```sh
$ cd open-source-projects
```

---


6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY
```

---


7. Press `Enter`. Your local clone will be created.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

**Tip: The error message "fatal: destination path 'REPOSITORY-NAME' already exists and is not an empty directory" means that your current working directory already contains a repository with the same name.

To resolve the error, you must clone the fork in a different directory.**

---


8. Navigate into your new cloned repository.

```sh
$ cd FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY
```

---


9. Switch branches to the compare branch of the pull request where the original changes were made.

If you navigate to the original pull request, you'll see the compare branch at the top of the pull request.



![xxx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-git-article/master/img/commands/compare-branch-example.png)

In this example, the compare branch is `test-branch`:
```sh
$ git checkout test-branch
```

---


10. At this point, you can do anything you want with this branch. You can push new commits to it, run some local tests, or merge other branches into it, including `master`. Make modifications as you like.

---


11. After you commit your changes to the head branch of the pull request you can push your changes up to the original pull request directly.

In this example, the head branch is `test-branch`:

```sh
$ git push origin test-branch
> Counting objects: 32, done.
> Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
> Compressing objects: 100% (26/26), done.
> Writing objects: 100% (29/29), 74.94 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
> Total 29 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0)
> To https://github.com/USERNAME/FORK-OF-THE-REPOSITORY.git
> 12da2e9..250e946  test-branch -> test-branch
```

Your new commits will be reflected on the original pull request on GitHub.
