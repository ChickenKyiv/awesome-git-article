If your pull request compares your `topic branch` with a branch in the upstream repository
as the `base branch`, then your topic branch is also called the `compare branch` of the pull request.



**Note: To open a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch or, for organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open a pull request.**
