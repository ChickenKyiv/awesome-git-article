Filtering files in a pull request

#### To help you quickly review changes in a large pull request, you can filter changed files.


You can filter files in a pull request by file extension type,
such as .html or .js, no extension, code ownership, or dotfiles.

**Tip: To simplify your pull request diff view, you can also temporarily hide deleted files or files you have already viewed in the pull request diff from the file filter drop-down menu.**


1. Under your repository name, click  `Pull requests`.

2. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request you'd like to filter.

3. On the pull request, click  `Files changed`.

4. Use the File filter drop-down menu, and select, unselect, or click the desired filters.
