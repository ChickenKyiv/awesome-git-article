What's your typical process for reviewing a pull request in GitHub?

When I did code reviews, and for any team I lead from a technical aspect for, my a review has three phases of confirmation:

#### Automatic

- Did the testing pass? If not, stop.
- Did the change add/remove tests? Why?
- Did the code quality decrease measurably?
- Did the change introduce possible future technical debt? Is it acceptable?
- Did any of the tooling indicate a decrease in maintainability or compliance?

#### Operation

- Does the change satisfy the statement of work submitted for the change?
- Does the change logic look reasonable?
- Can I follow the logic change in text, mentally, and not get lost.

#### Experience

- From the end/admin/manager/etc users perspective does the change function as expected?

Sure it seems like a lot, and yes it may slow down
the merge process a bit.
But in my experience taking a little longer to review code
can help prevent issues from getting to production.

The holy grain though is a 100% automated process
with confidence in the automation that when a change begins
throwing errors the changes are rolled back,
the errors logged, and the committing developer alerted.

**I would advise against merging code with bugs, which can end up in production pretty easily if you are not careful.**

That's a great point, and to clarify,
I wouldn't usually approve a PR with bugs.
But I think there are cases where it's acceptable:

- The only bugs are design inconsistencies or
unclear requirements (in larger organizations, these can take weeks to resolve).

- We're doing new feature development,
the PR is a major net improvement over what we had before,
and the bugs are minor and part of the new feature (not regressions).

- The team agrees that the PR is large enough
and affects enough things that we should merge,
deploy it to the company's internal server,
and get a lot of eyes on it as quickly as possible.
This is an intentional delay of all other work until
the code in question is thoroughly tested.

Every day that a PR sits unresolved is technical debt;
it gets further and further out of sync
with the master branch, the original author
starts to forget what they did,
and all the people that could have been
using and testing the new code, aren't.

So the risk of letting bugs into production
isn't the only risk in this situation, nor,
I submit, is it always the greatest risk.

**Flow for when I am familiar with the code**

**The Why** - Understanding the the reason for the changes. Was this a bug? Was this a feature request?

a. **Bug** - Does this change fix the bug? Does it introduce any other possible bugs?

b. **Feature Request** - Look at the corresponding JIRA ticket to ensure that all parts of the feature request are complete.

**Logic** - Dig into the logic and ensure that it all works like it should. Unless the logic is extremely complex, I usually will not pull a branch down and test it myself. We have a pretty comprehensive test suite and if there are good tests written for the new code its usually unnecessary to test manually unless its a big feature which will go through Q/A.

**Performance** - Are there any unnecessary MySQL queries? Are indexes in place where they should be? How will this code perform when executed a million times? How will this code affect our databases?

**Edge Cases** - Since becoming a Site Reliability Engineer, I feel like a lot of my work deals with edge cases. Code works 99% of the time, but if given this scenario, it breaks. I like to take a step back and look at the big picture for PR. How will this interact with other moving pieces of the code?

**Code style and cleanliness** - Are there bits that could be refactored to be more readable or more reusable? Are any variables not quite clear based on their naming?

**When the PR deals with code I am unfamiliar with**
**ASK QUESTIONS!** - I cannot tell you how valuable it can be when someone asks you questions about a PR.

For a while, at my job I was the resident export at Elasticsearch.
Because of that people, who shy away from reviewing my PRs bc they went beyond their own Elasticsearch knowledge.

Since I wanted my code reviewed I started to tell people to just ask me questions.

Have me explain the parts you don't get. By explaining how things worked, half of the time I would find the bugs myself. Plus, if you ask questions then you become more familiar with the code yourself.
