#### If reviewers give you feedback on a pull request, you can incorporate it manually and accept suggested changes automatically.



## Applying suggested changes

Other people can suggest specific changes to your pull request. You can apply these suggested changes directly in a pull request if you have write access to the repository. If the pull request was created from a fork and the author allowed edits from maintainers,
you can also apply suggested changes if you have write access to the upstream repository.


To quickly incorporate more than one suggested change into a single commit, you can also apply suggested changes as a batch. Applying one suggested change or a batch of suggested changes creates a single commit on the compare branch of the pull request.

Each person who suggested a change included in the commit will be a co-author of the commit. The person who applies the suggested changes will be a co-author and the committer of the commit. For more information about the term committer in Git, see `"Git Basics - Viewing the Commit History"` from the Pro Git book site.
