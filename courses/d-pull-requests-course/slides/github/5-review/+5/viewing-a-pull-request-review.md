#### You can view all of the comments made in a single pull request review.


You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for review with the search qualifier `review-requested:[USERNAME]` or `team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME]`.



When you view a full review, you'll see the same version of the pull request as the reviewer did at the time of the review.

1. Under your repository name, click  `Pull requests`.

2. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request you'd like to review.

3. On the "Conversation" tab, scroll to the review you'd like to see, then click `View changes`.
