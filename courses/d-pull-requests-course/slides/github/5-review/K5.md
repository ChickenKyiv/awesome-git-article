In a pull request, you can review and discuss commits, changed files, and the differences (or `"diff"`) between the files in the base and compare branches.

In this slides section we'll talk about:
- Reviewing pull requests
- Starting a review
- Marking a file as viewed
- Submitting your review

**Marking a file as viewed**

After you finish reviewing a file, you can mark the file as viewed, and the file will collapse.

If the file changes after you view the file, it will be unmarked as viewed.



1. On the pull request, click  `Files changed`.

Notes:


A. If required reviews are enabled and a collaborator with write, admin, or owner access to the repository submits a review requesting changes, the pull request cannot be merged until the same collaborator submits another review approving the changes in the pull request.






B. Repository owners and administrators can merge a pull request even if it hasn't received an approving review, or if a reviewer who requested changes has left the organization or is unavailable.


C. If both required reviews and stale review dismissal are enabled and a code-modifying commit is pushed to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval is dismissed.

The pull request must be reviewed and approved again before it can be merged.



D. When several open pull requests each have a head branch pointing to the same commit, you wonâ€™t be able to merge them if one or both have a pending or rejected review.
