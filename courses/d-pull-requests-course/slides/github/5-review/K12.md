Notes:


A. If required reviews are enabled and a collaborator with write, admin, or owner access to the repository submits a review requesting changes, the pull request cannot be merged until the same collaborator submits another review approving the changes in the pull request.






B. Repository owners and administrators can merge a pull request even if it hasn't received an approving review, or if a reviewer who requested changes has left the organization or is unavailable.


C. If both required reviews and stale review dismissal are enabled and a code-modifying commit is pushed to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval is dismissed.

The pull request must be reviewed and approved again before it can be merged.



D. When several open pull requests each have a head branch pointing to the same commit, you wonâ€™t be able to merge them if one or both have a pending or rejected review.
