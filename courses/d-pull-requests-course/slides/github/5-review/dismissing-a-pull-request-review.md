Dismissing a pull request review

#### If your repository requires reviews, you can dismiss pull request reviews that are
## no longer valid or are unable to be approved by the reviewer.

If a pull request has changed since it was reviewed and the person who requested
changes isn't available to give an approving review, repository administrators or
people with write access can dismiss a review.

This changes the status of the review to a review comment. When you dismiss a review,
you must add a comment explaining why you dismissed it.
Your comment will be added to the pull request conversation.

You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for
review with the search qualifier `review-requested:[USERNAME]` or `team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME]`.
