Why I personally like pull request templates?
Because only robots and automatization can help me to not being lazy.
When I introduce templates to my interns, it was cool to see how
interns reacting to these changes.
It improving our process a bit.

And saving my time, when I have a few pending pull requests
at different repositories and description helping me to understand what was done.


Cool repositories:
- https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates
- https://github.com/devspace/awesome-github-templates,
- https://github.com/embeddedartistry/templates/blob/master/oss_docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
