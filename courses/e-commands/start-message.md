Welcome to course, where you will learn about advanced usages of basic git commands.

For this course, I tried to pack a lot of different cases-situations-scenarios that can become a reality in your daily work.

Cases like that are pretty common:
I forget what was done?
I want to revert changes that generate a bug.
I staged too many edits, and I want to break them out into a separate commit?

All of the situations that were covered in this course looks pretty simple and straight-forward, but when situation appear - you should what to do.

This course is about learning how to apply basic commands like, commit, checkout, log, diff, stash and use them for troubleshooting.

You will learn about more than 30 cases, that can be useful for software developers.

This course will guide you through different real-life situations, that can be solved by using Gitcommands.
It will give you a better understanding of how to do stuff and can help you to be a better developer and you will be able to avoid some major problems in the future of your coding career.


<!--

I'm very glad that you decide to join my course.
Knowledge of pull requests is essential for any software engineer, in my opinion. Communication and collaboration skills are undervalued at modern tech society.

I think you cannot create great software on your own.
When you working as a team member, collaboration is a very crucial part of the process. When you can showcase what you're doing and communicate with other people while you showing your code - you can accomplish more. And spend less time.


Hope you will enjoy this course! Good luck.

Welcome to the ZIZO design and product ideation course. This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs, startups founders and product managers to learn a new and proven way to build product ideas from scratch and improve existing product features by zooming in and zooming out the different design layers. The course teaches how to use the three design layers (Flow, Interface, and Action) and build your startup product ideas from both high level and strategic perspective and the most detailed level of user action design.

I am working with startups in diverse fields from AI to medical devices, and guide their teams to ideate iterate and zoom in and zoom out constantly to align the team and optimize their products. I have been working with startups from top programs such as Singularity University, WeWork Labs and Zinc.VCs.

This course was created because of the feedback and great demand I saw in startup founders after consultation sessions and workshops. Now it's available for everyone!
