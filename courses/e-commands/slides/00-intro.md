Welcome to course, where you will learn about advanced usages of basic git commands.

For this course, I tried to pack a lot of different cases-situations-scenarios that can become a reality in your daily work.

Cases like that are pretty common:
- "I forget what was done?"
- "I want to revert changes that generate a bug."
- "I staged too many edits, and I want to break them out into a separate commit?"

All of the situations that were covered in this course looks pretty simple and straight-forward, but when situation appear - you should know what to do.

This course is about learning how to apply basic commands like, commit, checkout, log, diff, stash and use them for troubleshooting.

You will learn about more than 30 cases, that can be useful for software developers.


We don't touching here merge scenario at all, because this topic is huge and it better to be talked separately.
