#### I want to delete or remove my last commit

If you need to delete pushed commits, you can use the following.

However, it will irreversibly change your history, and mess up the history of anyone else who had already pulled from the repository.

In short, if you're not sure, you should never do this, ever.

```
$ git reset HEAD^ --hard
$ git push --force-with-lease [remote] [branch]
```

If you haven't pushed, to reset Git to the state it was in before you made your last commit (while keeping your staged changes):

`(my-branch*)$ git reset --soft HEAD@{1}`

This only works if you haven't pushed. If you have pushed, the only truly safe thing to do is git revert `SHAofBadCommit`(i.e. commit hash code ).

That will create a new commit that undoes all the previous commit's changes.

Or, if the branch you pushed to is rebase-safe (ie. other devs aren't expected to pull from it), you can just use `git push --force-with-lease`.
