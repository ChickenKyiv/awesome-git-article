Now, you want to just see the output or code of that branch before you made those changes.

Then you can run stash command. It will make your working tree clean.

`git stash`

If you want your changes back then you have to run the following command.

`git stash pop`

---

If you donâ€™t want those changes back then you have to run the following command.

`git stash drop`

You changed some files in wrong branch.

Then you can stash your changes and checkout to your desired branch

and run `git stash pop` there.

You will get your changes in your desired branch.
