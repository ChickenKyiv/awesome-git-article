Code review is a major benefit of pull requests, but they’re actually designed to be a generic way to talk about code.

 You can think of pull requests as a discussion dedicated to a particular branch.

 This means that they can also be used much earlier in the development process.
 For example, if a developer needs help with a particular feature, all they have to do is file a pull request. Interested parties will be notified automatically, and they’ll be able to see the question right next to the relevant commits.



Once a pull request is accepted, the actual act of publishing a feature is much the same as in the Centralized Workflow. First, you need to make sure your local master is synchronized with the upstream master. Then, you merge the feature branch into master and push the updated master back to the central repository.
