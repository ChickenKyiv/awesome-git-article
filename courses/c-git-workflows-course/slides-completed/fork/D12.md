In the developer's local copy of the forked repository they can edit code, commit changes, and create branches just like in other Git workflows:

`git checkout -b some-feature`
# Edit some code
`git commit -a -m "Add first draft of some feature"`

All of their changes will be entirely private until they push it to their public repository.
And, if the official project has moved forward, they can access new commits with git pull:

`git pull upstream master`

Since developers should be working in a dedicated feature branch, this should generally result in a fast-forward merge.
