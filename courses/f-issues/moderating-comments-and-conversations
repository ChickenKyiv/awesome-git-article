## Moderating comments and conversations
#### Moderating conversations creates a welcoming community for all contributors to your project by promoting healthy collaboration and de-escalating conflict. You can apply your community's code of conduct to discussions by editing and deleting comments and locking conversations.


#### Managing disruptive comments
If you have write permissions to a repository, you can hide, edit, or delete comments.

#### Locking conversations
Repository owners and collaborators, and people with write access to a repository, can lock conversations on issues, pull requests, and commits permanently or temporarily to defuse a heated interaction.

#### Tracking changes in a comment
Anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. Comment authors and people with write access to a repository can delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history.

## Managing disruptive comments
#### If you have write permissions to a repository, you can hide, edit, or delete comments.

In this section:

- Hiding a comment
- Unhiding a comment
- Editing a comment
- Deleting a comment

People with write access to a repository can hide, unhide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also edit or delete a comment on a team page.

Anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. A person with write access to the repository can delete sensitive information from the edit history.

#### Hiding a comment

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

## Editing a comment
It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's Community Guidelines.

When you edit a comment, note the location that
the content was removed from and optionally,
the reason for removing it. The **edited** dropdown at the
top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

5. Click **Update comment**.


## Deleting a comment
Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's Community Guidelines.

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

**Note**
The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click **...**, then click **Delete**.

comment-menu (2)

3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.
