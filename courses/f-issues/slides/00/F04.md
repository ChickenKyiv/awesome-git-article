## Milestones, Labels, and Assignees



Once you’ve collected a lot of issues, you may find it hard to find the ones you care about.
**Milestones**, **labels**, and **assignees** are great features to filter and categorize issues.

You can change or add a milestone, an assignee, and labels by clicking their corresponding gears in the sidebar on the right.



If you don’t see edit buttons, that’s
because you don’t have permission to edit the issue.

You can ask the repository owner to add you as a collaborator to get access.
