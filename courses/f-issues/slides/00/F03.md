GitHubâ€™s issue tracking is special because of our focus on collaboration, references, and excellent text formatting.

 A typical issue on GitHub looks a bit like this:


![xxx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChickenKyiv/awesome-git-article/master/img/issues/example-issue.png)


- A **title** and **description** describe what the issue is all about.



- **Color-coded labels** help you categorize and filter your issues (just like labels in email).




- A milestone acts like a container for issues.
This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases (e.g. **Weekly Sprint 9/5-9/16** or **Shipping 1.0**).




- One assignee is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.




- Comments allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.
