Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period.

People use them in many different ways in software development.

Some examples of milestones on GitHub include:

- **Beta Launch** — File bugs that you need to fix before you can launch the beta of your project.
It’s a great way to make sure you aren’t missing anything.

- **October Sprint** — File issues that you’d like to work on in October.
A great way to focus your efforts when there’s a lot to do.

- **Redesign** — File issues related to redesigning your project.
A great way to collect ideas on what to work on.
