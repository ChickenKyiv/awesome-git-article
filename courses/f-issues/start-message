Welcome to the course, where you'll learn about GitHub issues, repository section. It's an awesome and free tool for public repositories at Git Hub. This course will be helpful for developers.
But not only for coders, actually. Project managers, repository maintainers, clients that need help from developers, ==> all these people will find this course useful. If you want to learn how to lead the team of developers. If you want to get things done and set up a great and clear development workflow, especially if your team is diverse and contains people with different levels of knowledge --> this course will help you as well.

There a lot of different tools that can help to manage people, coding processes, resolve problems and actually release a product and maintain if after that.

As PM, I tried different tools before. For the last few years, I'm using only GitHub issues because it gives me the ability to work closely with code and manage my students.

Even if you use most other task management tools --> this course will show you different ways/approaches for using tasks/issues for your needs.

Even book writers or scientists using GitHub for their work. I hope you'll enjoy this course and your work and work of your team because easier and less stressful.
