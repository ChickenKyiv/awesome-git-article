## About conversations on GitHub
#### You can discuss specific projects and changes, as well as broader projects or team goals, using different types of discussions on GitHub.

#### Discussions on GitHub
You can create and participate in issues, pull requests, and team discussions, depending on the type of conversation you'd like to have.

Pull requests allow you to comment directly on proposed changes.

- Commenting on a pull request https://help.github.com/en/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request

On your team's page, you can use team discussions for conversations that span across projects or repositories and don't belong in a specific issue or pull request. Instead of opening an issue in a repository to discuss an idea, you can include the entire team by having a conversation in a team discussion.

#### Reacting to ideas in comments
You can show your support or dissent for an idea in a conversation. When you add a reaction to a comment or the body of a team discussion, issue, or pull request, people subscribed to the conversation won't receive a notification.

>> Tip: You can also add reactions using your mobile device.


#### Following contribution guidelines

Before you open an issue or pull request,
check to see if the repository has contributing guidelines.
The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file includes information about how the repository maintainer would like you
to contribute ideas to the project.

Similar to contributing guidelines,
the repository maintainer may have included a template
for information to include in an issue or pull request.

Completing the prompts from the template may help you
get a better response from maintainers.
