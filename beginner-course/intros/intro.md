----

In its simplest term it’s like a “Save As”. You want the new file without getting rid of the changes on the old one. It’s an everyday situation, except on a software project there is the potential for a lot of changes.

Repository/repo: The database storing the files.

Branch: Create a separate copy of a repo for use on your computer.

Revert/rollback: Go back to a previously saved version of the codebase/repo.

Push: Push is an access level on the repo, if you have no push access you will need to make a pull request.

Pull: If you have no Push access you can make a pull request which will notify the repo owner you want to merge your changes into their code.
