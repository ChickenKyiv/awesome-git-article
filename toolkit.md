## TOOLKIT
- For practice I use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [Github](https://github.com/) - if you ok to share your code with other -  My current pick
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)  - if you want to have a free storage
- [Google drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) & [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2) - if you just want to save your code at cloud
- You can also use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard) of some other stuff.

Code editors
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) I use it for around 6 years. Small size and has everything important.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) because it's baked by GitHub team and it also has a GitHub sync.
